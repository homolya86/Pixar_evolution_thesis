01 - Dinoco 400
:[The screen shows a dark background as a racer's voice is heard, inhaling and exhaling deeply.]
Lightning McQueen: Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed.
:[The screen then shows some race cars whizzing past on a racetrack, then it goes back to dark again.]
Lightning McQueen: One winner. 42 losers. I eat losers for breakfast.
:[The screen then shows McQueen from the back of his left side as he accelerates and gains on a racer. Then the screen goes dark again.]
Lightning McQueen: Breakfast? Wait, maybe I should've had breakfast? A little breaky could be good for me. No, no, no, stay focused. Speed!
:[The screen then shows race cars whizzing along the racetrack as the camera moves to the right. The screen then goes dark again]
Lightning McQueen: I'm faster than fast, quicker than quick! I am Lightning!
Mack: [pounds on Lightning's trailer door] Hey Lightnin'! Ya ready?
Lightning McQueen: [Real Gone plays as the trailer door opens] Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.
:[As "Real Gone" by Sheryl Crow plays, McQueen revs his engine, and his different body parts are shown as he drives slowly out of the trailer with his face visible. He later revs his engine again as the crowd cheers. The camera shows an aerial view of Motor Speedway of the South, as a cameraman aims his camera at McQueen. The camera shows Lightning on the scoring pylon screen. Finally, it zooms on McQueen as he yells his catchphrase to the fans]
Lightning McQueen: Ka-chow!
:[The song continues playing as the camera shows race cars zooming along the racetrack. McQueen easily overtakes six racers. He then gets blocked by two racers, in order to overtake both of them, he squeezes between the two driving on two wheels on to the circuit's wall. The camera then shows McQueen on the scoring pylon screen as he winks, Mia and Tia screams in excitement, the camera then shows the audience cheering, then it skips to a pickup truck selling some souvenirs]
Brian: Get your antenna balls here!
:[The camera cuts to the race in progress as it shows the infield full of RVs, two RVs in particular are seen cheering loudly at McQueen]
Larry: Go Lightnin'! Whoo hoo!
R.M.: You got that right, slick. [whistles]
:[The camera cuts again to the racers, this time, they are in the pits with air wrenches whirring and crew chiefs barking orders. The men and women restroom are seen, with the women restroom having a line of female cars waiting to use it. The scene cuts to the infield where an RV dressed up like Elvis Presley is seen as he finishes Sheryl Crow's line. The scene is now showing the leaders of the race, with consistent runner-up Chick Hicks purposefully hitting the racer in first place as he swerves off the track and loses control, Chick is later overtaken by seven-time Piston Cup champion Strip Weathers, otherwise known as "The King"]
:[The camera zooms in to the announcers' skybox booth, where Bob Cutlass and Darrell Cartrip are seen]
Bob Cutlass: Welcome back to the Dinoco 400, I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip, we're midway through what may turn out to be a historic day for racing.
Darrell Cartrip: Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof right now. If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!
Bob Cutlass: Right you are, Darrell. Three cars are tied for the season points lead, heading into the final race of the season. And the winner of this race Darrell, will win the season title and, the Piston Cup. Does The King, Strip Weathers, have one more victory in him before retirement?
:[The camera zooms into The King as he is seen leading the pack, with three clips playing on-screen; one of them shows The King's number and sponsor, the other one shows The King and his team at the Dinoco tent, and the third one shows The King in front of his seven Piston Cup trophies.]
Darrell Cartrip: He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years! Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
Bob Cutlass: And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks. He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.
:[The camera zooms into Chick as he is seen in second place, with five clips playing on-screen; one showing Chick's rear bumper, the other one repeatedly zooming in and zooming out of Chick's number, the third one showing Chick losing various races to The King and McQueen, the fourth one showing Chick angrily looking up to The King and McQueen as they both finished ahead of him, and the last one showing Chick as he looks arrogantly at the camera.]
Darrell Cartrip: Chick thought this was his year, Bob. His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow. But the last thing he expected was... Lightning McQueen!
Bob Cutlass: You know, I don't think anybody expected this. The rookie sensation came into the season unknown. But everyone knows him now.
:[The camera zooms into Lightning as he is seen in third place, just a few centimeters behind Chick, with three clips playing on-screen; one showing Lightning's number and contingency sponsors, the second one showing Lightning slowly spinning on a turntable, and the third one showing Lightning as he knocks down a stack of tires.]
Darrell Cartrip: Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
Bob Cutlass: The legend, the runner up, and the rookie! Three cars, one champion!
:[Chick desperately tries to overtake The King, but to no avail. McQueen slowly gains on Chick and the two fight for the second position.]
Chick: No, you don't.
:[McQueen manages to overtake Chick, as the latter bumps on the former, causing McQueen to lose control as he swerves into the infield. The crowd is heard booing at Chick for this.]
Larry: Ooh. What a ride!
Chick: [laughs]
Larry: Go get 'em, McQueen! Go get 'em!
Mia: I love you, Lightning! [whistles, McQueen quickly gets back on to the racetrack, Chick looks back and sees that McQueen is in last place.]
Chick: Dinoco is all mine. [bumps a racer, who slides into the wall, and collides with another racer and creates a domino effect involving 33 racers]
Darrell Cartrip: Trouble, turn-3!
Chick: [chuckles] Get through that, McQueen.
Bob Cutlass: Oh, a huge crash behind the leaders!
Fans: [gasps, the camera shows all racers as they collide, with one racer flying through the air, and another racer losing its tire. Two racers suddenly stop, facing towards each other. One of them giggles, the other smiles as he gets hit by two cars, the first one gasps as a racer comes towards him, they collide, and end up upside down on each other's roofs, they scream in confusion. The camera shows McQueen, who is driving through the wreckage and carefully dodging the other racers.]
Bob Cutlass: Wait a second, Darrell. McQueen is in the wreckage.
Darrell Cartrip: There's no way the rookie can make it through! Not in one piece that is.
:[McQueen's continues dodging the other racers who are sliding across the track. Then he bounces on Claude's undercarriage and flies up into the air, McQueen exhales deeply and he sticks his tongue out. He moves his lightning bolt sticker towards the audience, a reflection of McQueen's bolt sticker shines on them]
Mia and Tia: Lightning, oh! [sighs passionately]
:[McQueen then lands back on the ground, releasing sparks and tire marks on the process.]
Darrell Cartrip: Look at that, McQueen made it through!
Bob Cutlass: Man, a spectacular move by Lightning McQueen.
Lightning McQueen: Yeah! Ka-chow!
Fans: [chanting] McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!...
Albert Hinkey: Yeah McQueen! Ka-chow!! [honks his horn, while the crowd members around him are disgusted by its loud noise]
Bob Cutlass: While everyone else heads into the pits, McQueen stays out, to take the lead!
:[While Bob is talking, the pace car drives in front of McQueen. The camera cuts to show a tow truck towing a damaged racer as he claims that he is still able to race]
Chuck Armstrong: Don't take me out coach, I can still race!
:[The camera shows the pit row with many racers taking a pit stop, while others are seen getting towed out of the race for repairs. Chick is seen laughing as he takes a pit stop]
Chick: [chuckles] What do you think boys? A thing of beauty.
Chief Chick: McQueen made it through!
Chick: What?!
:[The camera zooms into the speedway's big television screen, as it shows McQueen just behind the pace car.]
Chief Chick: He's not pitting!
Chick: Come on, you gotta get me out there! Let's go, gotta get me back out there! Come on!
Bob Cutlass: McQueen's not going into the pits!
Darrell Cartrip: You know the rookie just fired his crew chief! That's the third one this season!
:[The other racers are seen driving through the pit lane and back onto the track]
Bob Cutlass: Well, he says he likes working alone, Darrell.
:[While Bob is talking, Chick is seen finishing his pit stop as the other racers are driving past him, Chick then starts off, getting in the back of the pack.]
Chief Chick: Go, go, go!
Bob Cutlass: Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.
Darrell Cartrip: Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up. Get ready boys, we're comin' to the restart! [The crowd is heard cheering as the race restarts with McQueen starting in first place. Meanwhile, both The King and Chick are seen struggling to reach their usual positions in front of the pack. McQueen comes in to the pits as his pit crew are quickly searching for new tires, one of them injects Dinoco fuel on Lightning's gas cap.]
Not Chuck: We need tires now! Come on, let's go!
Lightning McQueen: No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas! [drives away]
Not Chuck: You need tires, you idiot!
:[One of Lightning's pitties throws a tire to the ground, while others are seen visibly angry at Lightning.]
Darrell Cartrip: Looks like it's all gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
Bob Cutlass: That's right. No tires again.
Darrell Cartrip: Normally I said a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it's sure is workin' for him. He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.
:[The scene cuts to show Lightning having a huge advantage over his 22 competitors, with him almost lapping the racer in last place]
Bob Cutlass: This is it, Darrell, one lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
Darrell Cartrip: Aw, he's got it in the bag. Call in the dogs and put out the fire! We're gonna crowm us a new champion!
Fans: [all cheering and whistling, Mia and Tia scream in excitement]
Lightning McQueen: Checkered flag, here I come! [Suddenly, McQueen's rear left tire blows]
Darrell Cartrip: Oh no! McQueen has blown a tire!
:[crowd gasps]
Bob Cutlass: And with only one turn to go! Do you can he make it?
Not Chuck: You fool! [One of Lightning's pitties grunts and knocks down a cart of tires, McQueen is struggling to get to the finish line while his bare wheel causes sparks on the track. The camera then shows The King and Chick as they see McQueen's blown tire on the TV screen.]
Roger Wheeler (And The King Crew Chief): [on radio] McQueen's blown a tire, McQueen's blown a tire! Go, go, go, go, go, and GO!
:[The King and Chick speed up as McQueen is driving slightly slower due to his blown tire, McQueen grunts as his rear right tire blows]
Darrell Cartrip: He's lost another tire! The King and Chick are coming up fast!
Bob Cutlass: They're entering turn-3!
Lightning McQueen: Come on. [grunts]
Darrell Cartrip: I don't believe what I'm watchin', Bob! Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup! [McQueen gasps and continuously does several jumps towards the finish line as The King and Chick are getting closer, Chick growls and finally gets beside The King, but not in front of him]
Bob Cutlass: The King and Chick rounding turn-4. [The King and Chick are now on the same stretch as McQueen]
Darrell Cartrip: And, down the stretch they come! And it's, and it's... [The King and Chick both cross the finish line along with McQueen as he sticks his tongue out]
Bob Cutlass: It's too close to call! Too close to call!
Darrell Cartrip: I don't believe it! I don't believe it!
Mia & Tia: Lightning! [Screams, all cheering]
Bob Cutlass: [while Darrell is talking] The most spectacular, amazing unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world! And we don't even know who won!
Darrell Cartrip: I don't believe it! I still don't believe it! Haha, look at that!

02 - Victory Lane
:[The officials are then shown watching replays of the finish at different angles. Meanwhile, one of the security officers, named Richard Clayton Kensington, notices someone watching them with a camera.]
Richard Clayton Kensington: Hey, no Cameras! Get outta here! [The screen shows from a reporter's camera filming Kori Turbowitz with McQueen and his pit crew as the Rust-eze pitties change his tires]
Kori Turbowitz: We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the race results. McQueen that was quite a risky move, not taking tires.
Not Chuck: Tell me about it.
Kori Turbowitz: Are you sorry you don't have a crew chief out there?
Lightning McQueen's Crew: [laughs]
Lightning McQueen: [Chuckles] Oh, Kori, there's a lot more to racing than just winning. I mean, takin' the race by a full lap, where's the entertainment in that? No, no, no, I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
Not Chuck: Sizzle?
Lightning McQueen: Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief? No, I'm not. 'Cause I'm a one-man show.
Not Chuck: What? Oh, yeah right.
Kori Turbowitz: [to the TV audience] That was a very confident Lightning McQueen. Coming to you live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz.
:[Kori then drives away, while the reporter tries to get McQueen's bolt sticker on the TV screen. Not Chuck was blocking the view while changing one of McQueen's tires]
Cameraman: Hey, get outta the shot!
Lightning McQueen: Yo, Chuck, what are you doin'? You're blockin' the camera! Everyone wants to see the bolt!
Not Chuck: WHAT?!
Lightning McQueen: Now, back away.
Not Chuck: [grunts and slams his air wrench towards the ground] THAT'S IT!! Come on, guys! [Lightning's pitties then leave, as one of them drops McQueen onto the ground]
Lightning McQueen: OOWWWWW! Whoa, team! Where are you going?
Not Chuck: WE QUIT, MR. ONE-MAN SHOW!
Lightning McQueen: Oh, oh, oh, oh, OK, leave. Fine! [laughs] How will I ever find anyone else who knows how to fill me up with gas?
:[The reporters laugh]
Lightning McQueen: Adiós, Chuck!
Not Chuck: AND MY NAME'S NOT CHUCK!
Lightning McQueen: Oh, whatever.
Chick: Hey, Lightning! Yo, McQueen, seriously, that was some pretty darn nice racin' out there. [suddenly jumps in front of his pitties] BY ME! [chuckles] Welcome to the Chick era, baby! The Piston Cup, it's mine, dude. It's mine. Hey, fellas, how do you think I'm look in Dinoco blue? DINOCO BLUE! [continues chuckling]
Lightning McQueen: In your dreams, Thunder.
Chick: Yeah, right. Thunder? What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
Lightning McQueen: You know, 'cause thunder always comes after... Lightning! [poses to the crowd] Pew, ka-ka-pow!
Chick: Who here knows about the pa-thunder thing?
Bruiser Bukowski: No, I didn't.
Cameramen: [The crowd then tries to take pictures of McQueen posing his flashing bolt sticker to them] McQueen! That's right, right in the lens. Show us the bolt! Show me the bolt, baby! Smile, McQueen! Show me the bolt, McQueen! That's it!
Tex: [Electronic music plays as the screen shows some cars entering the Dinoco tent, and some others chattering as they take pictures of the Dinoco Girls on stage. Then it shows Tex Dinoco, The King and Lynda Weathers] Oh, we that was one close finish. You sure made Dinoco proud. Thank you, King.
The King: Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years. It's the least I could do.
Lynda Weathers: Whatever happens, you're winner to me, you old daddy rabbit.
The King: Thanks, dear. We wouldn't be nothing without you.
:[The screen shows McQueen behind the winner's circle, posing his lightning bolt sticker to the crowd. Mia and Tia rush towards McQueen and greet him.]
Mia: I'm Mia.
Tia: I'm Tia.
Mia and Tia: We're like your biggest fans! Ka-chow! [they flash McQueen with their headlights]
Lightning McQueen: I love being me! [Then two police officers come up to move Mia and Tia away.]
:[Mia and Tia hide their headlights embarrassedly]
Security: Okay, girls, that's it.
Mia & Tia: We love you, Lightning!
Mia: I love you more!
:[McQueen laughs, and blows a kiss to Mia and Tia. Then The King comes up.]
The King: Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer.
Lightning McQueen: Oh, hey, Mr. The King.
The King: You got more talent in one lugnut than a lotta cars has got in their whole body.
Lightning McQueen: Really? Oh, that...
The King: But you're stupid.
Lightning McQueen: Excuse me?
The King: This ain't a one-man deal, kid. You need to wise-up and get yourself a good crew chief and a good team. And you ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, [his voice dwindles as McQueen looks towards the Dinoco stage] and you let them do their job, like they should. Like I tell the boys at the shop...
Lightning McQueen: [to himself] A good team, Yeah.
:[Electronic music plays as McQueen daydreams of being sponsored by Dinoco. It shows him with a trophy and two Dinoco Girls beside him, with one of the girls kissing him on the cheek. Then it shows his paint being changed to blue, removing his decals and replacing the Rust-eze logo with Dinoco's. It shows the text saying "The new face of Dinoco", and changing the text "The King" to a logo of McQueen with the text "Lightning McQueen". It then shows McQueen posing in a studio. Then it shows McQueen on the covers of some magazines, and then it shows him with Mia and Tia in Dinoco paint on a red carpet being surrounded by a cheering crowd. Then it shows the text "Lightning McQueen is Lightning Storm". It shows some people being attacked by some giant robots with bodies shaped like spark plugs. One person, who gets zapped by a robot's laser, does the Wilhelm scream as he turns to dust. McQueen is flying in the air, and shoots missiles at the robots. Then the screen shows McQueen with Mia and Tia around the crowd from on the red carpet, which McQueen signs his tire marks on the Walk of Fame. Then it shows him inside a building near the Hollywood Sign, which he is between Mia and Tia painted gold. Both Mia and Tia repeatedly kiss McQueen on the sides. Then his daydream ends as the screen shows the present day.]
The King: [to McQueen] If you figure that out, you just gonna be OK.
Lightning McQueen: [McQueen clears throat] Oh, yeah, that is spectacular advice. Thank you, Mr. The King! Oh!
Bob Cutlass: [on speakers] Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in Piston Cup history...
Lightning McQueen: [revving his engine] A rookie has won the Piston Cup. [He rushes towards the winner's circle and already poses for the cameramen] YES!!
Bob Cutlass: [on speakers] ...we have a 3-way tie!
:[McQueen was shocked at this. The crowd then cheers and flash their cameras as confetti is shot. Then The King and Chick come onto the stage slowly]
Chick: [laughs] Hey, McQueen, that must be really embarrassing. But I wouldn't be worry about it, because I didn't do it! [laughing]
Bob Cutlass: Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race between the three leaders will be held in California in one week.
Chick: Well, thank you! Thanks to all of you out there! Thank you! [whispering to McQueen] Hey, rook, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself. [screaming to the crowd] Ah! No, not me! No, you rock, and you know that!
:[Then the screen shows fireworks exploding in the sky as a blimp named Al Oft watches from above]
Al Oft: Oh, yeah! Whoo!
Lightning McQueen: [The scene shows McQueen driving at the trailer parking lot, as he is headed towards his team trailer's parking space. Some pitties are seen loading their racer's tires onto their team trailer, including a Tank Coat pitty named Jerry Drivechain.] [mimicking Chick] "First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself." Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick. [McQueen turns right to his team trailer's parking space, only to find out it isn't there.] Huh?
Mack: Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
Lightning McQueen: I don't wanna talk about it. Come on, let's go, Mack. Saddle up. What'd you do with my trailer?
Mack: I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
Lightning McQueen: WHAT?!
Mack: Gotta make your personal appearance.

03 - Rust-eze
Lightning McQueen: No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! [The screen then shows a Rust-eze commercial featuring Lightning McQueen on a TV screen inside the Rust-eze tent] Yes, yes, yes! Lightning McQueen here. And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula! Nothing soothes rusty bumper like Rust-ezzzzzeeee. [A picture of a Rust-eze container moves across the rear bumper of a rusty car named Jonathan Wrenchworths. As the container moves, Jonathan's bumper becomes shiny. A text appears saying "Actual results may take up to 36 weeks."] Wow! Look at that shine! Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me! Ka-chow!
Rusty: [The commercial ends, and the screen zooms out to show the rusty cars in the Rust-eze tent. On the stage was the founder brothers Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze laughing] I met this car from Swampscott. He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow. [laughs]
Dusty: You could see his dirty undercarriage. [He crowd laughs, the screen zooms out to show McQueen and Mack outside the tent entrance which has two McQueen cardboard cut-outs. McQueen was hiding behind one of them]
Lightning McQueen: [exclaims disgusted] I hate rusty cars! This is not good for my image!
Mack: [to McQueen] They did give you your big break. Besides, it's in your contract.
Lightning McQueen: [to Mack] Oh, will you stop please? Just go get hooked up.
Dusty: Winter is a grand old time.
Rusty: Of this there are no ifs or buts. [While Dusty and Rusty are talking, McQueen is hiding behind a cardboard cut-out as he makes his way through the tent]
Dusty: But remember, all that salt and grime...
Rusty: Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
Dusty: [The cardboard cut-out falls down, exposing McQueen to the rusty cars] Hey, look! There he is! [The rusty cars in the crowd then turn towards McQueen] Our almost champ! Victory ran to your rear end in here, kid.
Rusty car 1: Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast!
J. Shoesteer: That race was a pisser!
Rusty car 3: Yeah, you were booking, McQueen!
Lightning McQueen: Give me a little room, guys.
Fred: You're my hero, Mr. McQueen!
Lightning McQueen: Yes, I know! [laughs as he reads Fred's name on his license plate] Fred, Fred, thank you!
Fred: He knows my name! HE KNOWS MY NAME!
:[his front bumper falls off, Dusty and Rusty laughs]
Dusty: Lookin' good, Freddie! [McQueen's and then get on the stage.]
Rusty: Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year!
Dusty: We might clear enough to buy you some headlights.
Rusty: Are you saying he doesn't have headlights?
Dusty: That's what I'm tellin' ya. It's just stickers!
Lightning McQueen: Well, ya know, race cars don't need headlights, because the track is always lit.
Rusty: Yeah, well, so is my brother, but he still needs headlights. [crowd laughs]
Lightning McQueen: [Does a forced laughter]
Both: Ladies and gentlemen, Lightning McQueen!
:[A spotlight shines on McQueen as the rusty cars remain silent with crickets chirping]
Mack: [off-screen] Free bird!
Lightning McQueen: You know, the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment team ran a great race today. And remember, with a little Rust-eze... [whispers to himself] And an insane amount of luck, [to the rusty cars] you too can look like me... Ka-chow!
Rusty: [The rusty cars cheer as McQueen drives to his trailer] Hey, kid.
Dusty: We love ya. And we're looking forward to another great year. Just like this year! [One of the brothers laughs as McQueen poses himself with a smile as the trailer door closes to show a picture of the same pose]
Lightning McQueen: Not on your life. [Mack drives away]
Rusty: Don't drive like my brother!
Dusty: Oh yeah, don't drive like my brother!

04 - "Life is a Highway"
Mack: California, here we come!
Lightning McQueen: Dinoco, here we come. 
:[The screen cuts to Mack exiting the Motor Speedway of the South and driving along the Interstate 40 to Los Angeles. Later, the screen shows Mack making faces with his reflection on the back of a tanker truck. A car named Bertha Butterswagon becomes confused by this. Then, the screen pans beside some telephone poles, where the birds from For the Birds are seen chirping. The screen then resumes to showing Mack progressing on his journey.]
Lightning McQueen: [The song ends in the evening, of that same day. The camera cuts to McQueen being massaged by brushes inside his trailer as the phone rings.] Oh... Oh, I needed this... [presses a button in order to answer the phone call, which deactivate the brushes as they go into the trailer's roof] Hello?
Harv: [on the phone] Is this Lightning McQueen, the world's fastest racing machine?
Lightning McQueen: Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?
Harv: [on the phone] And it is such a honor to be your agent and it almost hurts to take 10% of your winnings and merchandising and ancillary rights in perpetuity anyway. What a race! Hot champ?! I did-- I didn't see it, but I heard you were great.
Lightning McQueen: [presses a button in order to change the TV channel as it shows the 3-way tie of the previous race] Um... Thanks, Harv.
Harv: [on the phone] Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali. I'll pass 'em on to your friends. You shoot me the names. You let Harv rock it for you, alright, baby?
Lightning McQueen: Right! Friends! Yes, there's, um... [thinks]
Harv: [to McQueen] [on the phone] OK, I get it, Mr. Popular, so many friends you can't even narrow it down, hey, when you get to town, you better make time for your best friend. Gotta break bread with your mishpocheh here
Lightning McQueen: Yeah, yeah, that would be great! We should totally...
Harv: [on the phone] OK, I gotta jump, kid. L-Let me know how it goes. I'm out.
Lightning McQueen: [The phone call ends. McQueen sighs] [A minivan melodically honks his horn at Mack] What?! A minivan?! [on radio] Oh, come on, Mack, you're in the slow lane, this is Lightning McQueen you're haulin' here!
Mack: Just stoppin' off for a quick breather, kid. Old Mack needs a rest. [switches from the middle lane to the right lane in order to rest at the Top Down Truckstop]
Lightning McQueen: Absolutely not. We're driving straight to all night till we get to California, we agreed to it!
Mack: [switches back from the right lane to the middle lane] All night?! May I remind you, federal DOT regs sta-
Lightning McQueen: Come on, I need to get there before Chick get hang with Dinoco.
Mack: [sighs as he sees some trucks sleeping at the Top Down Truckstop] All those sleeping trucks! [on radio] Hey, kid, I don't know if I can make it.
Lightning McQueen: Oh, sure you can, Mack. Look, it'll be easy, I'll stay up with you!
Mack: [to McQueen] All night?
Lightning McQueen: All night long.
:[Later that night, McQueen is sleeping. McQueen snores]
:[The screen shows Mack, who is trying to stay awake. His engine slows down as his eyes start to shut. Mack snores, wakes up, gasps and blubbers, grunts as he tries to keep his eyes open. But they close again. Mack snores, and then wakes up, gasps and blubbers for about 5 seconds, and tries to keep his eyes open]
:[Rap music is heard as the screen shows close-ups of the Delinquent Road Hazards as they race through the Interstate. DJ is shown playing a song called Rollin' in the Rearview. Wingo is shown opening his shades. The screen cuts to all four Delinquent Road Hazards as they overtake two cars who angrily honk their horns at them, they later overtake a pickup truck named Duff Wrecks as he angrily scoffs at the four. Snot Rod sniffes two times and finally sneezes, causing him to reach his top speed and catch up to the trio as they all approach Mack. DJ drives to the right lane, Wingo and Boost drive to the left lane, and Snot Rod stays behind Mack. Wingo turns on his neon lights as he notices his reflection coming from Lightning's trailer, he proceeds to chuckle afterwards. Boost and DJ both drive in front of Mack, who is trying his best to stay awake.]
Boost: Hey, yo, DJ!
DJ: What up?!
Boost: We got ourselves a nodder!
DJ: [chuckles, Boost drives onto the right lane, while DJ drives onto the middle lane that Mack is on. DJ then plays the song Songbird.]
Mack: Pretty music. [falls asleep and snores]
Boost: Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man! [pushes Mack onto the left lane towards Wingo, pushes Mack back towards Boost]
Wingo: [chuckles] Right back at ya! [chuckles]
Snot Rod: Yeah!
Boost: [purposefully speeds in front of Mack] Oops! I missed!
Snot Rod: You goin' on vacation? [laughs]
Delinquent Road Hazards: [The four cars laugh as Mack, who is still sleeping, drives into some pebbles. The vibration of the pebbles cause McQueen to move slightly forward as he is still sleeping. One of Lightning's bobble heads falls from the trailer's shelf and on top of the button that opens the trailer's door. The pebbles' vibration continue to make McQueen move slightly forward to the trailer's door, which is pressing on the ground and causing sparks to appear. Wingo chuckles and Snot Rod begins to sniff]
Boost: Oh no, Snot Rod!
Wingo: He's gonna blow!
Snot Rod: [Boost, Wingo and DJ drive away as Snot Rod is still besides Mack and about to sneeze.] Ah...ah...ah...achoo!!!
Mack: [Snot Rod sneezes and drives away, Mack wakes up startled] GESUNDHEIT! Whoa, one should never drive while drowsy.

05 - Lost
:[McQueen falls off his trailer and into the highway. The trailer's door closes. The sounds of tires squealing and horns honking are heard as cars avoid to hit McQueen, who is still sleeping. McQueen wakes up, a truck's horn is heard as he slowly starts to approach McQueen, who is quick enough to dodge him. He later proceeds to dodge an SUV while driving on the wrong side of the road. Just then, three trucks are seen on each lane of the road honking their horns at McQueen, who quickly swerves off the road and into a bush.]
Lightning McQueen: Mack! [McQueen drives back on to the road, nearly hitting a car in the process. McQueen speeds up and overtakes some cars while trying to find Mack.] Mack! [He then notices a fleet of trucks in front of him. He drives faster, trying to find which truck is Mack.] Mack! Hey, Mack! Mack! [He notices a red truck with yellow lights exiting the highway and driving to another road nearby, thinking that it is Mack.] Mack! Mack, wait for me! [His engine is heard revving as he turns onto the same road that the truck is driving along. His tires squeal as he slides onto the road.] Mack! [The truck, whose face is not seen properly, drives through a level crossing without barriers. Afterwards, the bell starts to ring as the pair of antique "upper-quadrant" wigwag crossing signals wave. McQueen notices this and looks to his left only to find out a train named Trev Diesel is incoming. McQueen reaches his top speed as the train angrily blasts his horn at him. Both Trev and McQueen approach the level crossing. McQueen quickly jumps over the level crossing before the train could hit him.] Mack! Mack! [McQueen slowly approaches the truck, who is slowing down at a 3-way junction.] Mack! Mack... ...wait up! [coughs] Mack. Mack! Mack! [McQueen notices that the truck has a lightning bolt design on his sides, however, he then realizes that the truck is not Mack, but a Peterbilt named Jerry Recycled Batteries] What? You're not Mack.
Jerry Recycled Batteries: Mack?! I ain't no Mack, I'm a Peterbilt for dang sake! [Jerry drives away] Turn on your lights, you moron!
Lightning McQueen: Mack... The Interstate.
:[McQueen reverses and drives to the left lane, forgetting that he was actually on the right road to the Interstate before turning to the wrong road. The screen moves to show that he is actually on Route 66, then it cuts to an aerial view of him racing along the road. He then drives past a billboard where Sheriff was sleeping, however, he suddenly wakes up due to McQueen's loud engine]
Sheriff: [gasps] Not in my town, you don't. [chases after McQueen with his siren wailing]
Lightning McQueen: [notices Sheriff] Oh, no. Oh, maybe he can help me! [Suddenly, Sheriff is heard backfiring. McQueen thinks that Sheriff was shooting at him.] He's shootin' at me! Why is he shooting at me?
Sheriff: [backfiring] I haven't gone this fast in years. [Sheriff grunts as he backfires again] I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.
Lightning McQueen: Serpentine, serpentine, serpentine!
Sheriff: [noticing McQueen doing serpentine] What in the blue blazes?! Crazy hot-rodder! [he continues to chase after McQueen as his siren are still wailing.]
:[The scene cuts to Radiator Springs, with the song My Heart Would Know by Hank Williams playing. It shows a montage of the characters in their everydays. Some bugs are heard buzzing as they get attracted by the lights of Flo's V8 Café. Guido tries to keep a tire upright on top of another tire lying flat on the ground, which a sign being blown by the breeze keeps tilting it. Then it shows the statue of Stanley, which Red the fire truck is seen watering flowers around it. Lizzie is seen sleeping outside her curio shop. Ramone, Flo, Sarge and Fillmore are seen at Flo's V8 Café as Fillmore and Sarge are both watching the traffic light blinking from yellow to yellow.]
Fillmore: I'm tellin' ya, man, every third blink is slower.
Sarge: The sixties weren't good to you, were they? [Fillmore, Sarge and Ramone hear backfiring noises and they look up into the distance to figure it out what that was. The scene then goes to McQueen's still being chased by Sheriff as he sees Radiator Springs in the distance.]

06 - Into Town
Lightning McQueen: What? That's not the Interstate! [Suddenly, Sheriff backfires again. Lightning is startled by this and drives into a lane full of traffic cones] Ow, ow, ow, ow! [McQueen then drives off the road, and comes across a giant cone. He screams, tries to get back on the road, but is then caught by a fence filled with barbed wires.] Ow! [McQueen looks at a sign pointing to the left and saying "DRIVE THRU", so, he follows the sign. ]
Fillmore: I'm not the only seeing this, right?
:[McQueen races past Flo's V8 Café and accidentally knocks down a tower of oil cans in the process.]
Sarge: Incoming!
Fillmore: Whoa, man.
Lightning McQueen: No! [Sarge, Fillmore and Ramone drive out of the way. The barbed wire hits Ramone and slightly scratches his paint job. Guido hides behind a stack of tires.]
Ramone: Hey, you scratched my paint!
Lightning McQueen: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
:[McQueen accidentally knocks down Luigi and Guido's stack of tires]
Luigi: My tires!
:[He drives along the main road towards the courthouse, with tires all over his body. McQueen spits out a tire from his mouth. Red gasps and hides inside the building, McQueen spots Stanley's statue and quickly makes his way around it, killing Red's flowers in the process. However, the barbed wire gets stuck around the statue. McQueen notices this and reverses as hard as he can in order to be free from the statue. With his tires squealing and the barbed wire vibrating, he successfully manages to be free from the statue, as it flies up in the air. Suddenly, the statue lands in front of him, startles him, and the statue's pole start to tear and destroy the road apart. Flo, Ramone, Sarge and Fillmore watch McQueen tear the road in shock and anger. The statue continues to destroy the road apart, when it suddenly goes off road and splits a ramp in half. The ramp made the statue fly into the air, where it got stuck on some telephone wires. McQueen grunts and struggles to drive forward as he is also stuck, suddenly, the telephone wires pull McQueen backwards and launch the statue of Stanley into the air once again.]
Fillmore: Fly away, Stanley. Be free!
:[Red gasps as the statue flies towards him, and quickly hides back into the courthouse, the statue unexpectedly lands back on its original place without damage. Red witnesses the miracle in shock. The music resumes as Sheriff slowly approaches McQueen, who is hanging nose down from the telephone wires.]
Sheriff: Boy, you're in a heap of trouble. [McQueen sighs and passes out from exhaustion.]

07 - Where's McQueen?
Kori Turbowitz: [The next day, we see cameramen at the Los Angeles International Speedway watching Mack arrive.] We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen, is arriving at the track.
Cameramen: [The photographers are heard talking as they all surround Mack.] He's here! Is it true he's gonna pose for Car girl? Lightning, what's your strategy? [Lightning's trailer door opens revealing that there is nobody inside, the cameramen all gasp]
Mack: What? Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?
:[The words "LIGHTNING MCQUEEN MISSING" are shown on-screen]
:[Mack drives to Lightning's trailer, only to find out that his racer is nowhere to be seen]
News: McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing. Race car Lightning McQueen was reported missing. McQueen is scheduled to race in an unprecedented... [Dusty and Rusty are surrounded by many cameramen] Sponsor stated they have no idea where he is.
Chuki: (in Japanese) はい、マックイーンは今日姿を消しました。[Yes, McQueen disappeared today.]
Junior: I just hope Lightning's okay, I'd sure hate to see anything bad happen to him.
Jay Limo: I don't know what's harder to find, Lightning McQueen or a crew chief who'll work for him!
Sven: [German accent] Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!
:[The scene cuts to the RSN studio, where Chuck Manifold is reporting on Lightning's disappearance. In the background, there are many clips of the Dinoco 400 playing at the same time, all of these clips prominently feature McQueen.]
Chuck Manifold: They're all asking the same question: Where is McQueen?
:[A picture of Mack near Lightning's trailer appears on-screen, this time, there is a giant question mark in the middle of the picture.]

08 - The Impound
Lightning McQueen: [The screen shows McQueen waking up at the Radiator Springs Municipal Impound, later that morning as he starts to regain consciousness.] [McQueen sighs] Oh, boy. Oh... Where am I?
:[McQueen sees a rusty tow truck watching him sleep.]
Mater: Mornin', sleepin' beauty! [McQueen screams the screen then shows from McQueen's point of view as he wakes up. We see Mater outside the impound gate. Mater chuckling.] Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up!
Lightning McQueen: Take whatever you want! Just don't hurt me! [McQueen tries to reverse, then he felt a bump and heard a thud. He notices a parking boot on his tire, which it moves ahead as his tire was moving backwards.] The parking boot? Why do I have a parking boot on? [The screen zooms out to show our heroes in the impound.] What's going on here?! Please!
Mater: [McQueen tries to push the parking boot back, but it wouldn't go underneath his tire. Mater chuckles] You're funny, I like you already. My name's Mater.
Lightning McQueen: Mater?
Mater: Yeah, like "tuh-mater", but without the "tuh"! What's your names?
Lightning McQueen: Do you don't know my name?
Mater: Um, no, I know your name, is your name "Mater" too?
Lightning McQueen: What?! Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible, where am I?
Mater: Where are you?! Shoot! You're in Radiator Springs! The cutest little town in Carburetor County. [looks around to see a few old buildings]
Lightning McQueen: Oh, great. Just great!
Mater: Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town.
Lightning McQueen: You know? I'd love to see the rest of the town! So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off, you and me, we go cruisin', check out the local scene---
Mater: Dad-gum! [gets ready to press the button for the gate]
Lightning McQueen: How'd that be, Tuhmater? [about to press the button]
Mater: Cool!
Sheriff: MATER! [Mater then stops, and reverses as Sheriff arrives. McQueen then frown and some members of then feel sorry for Mater while some of them look confused.] What did I tell you about talkin' to the accused?!
Mater: To not to.
Sheriff: [presses the button to open the gate] Well, quit yer yappin' and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court.
Mater: [Mater whispering to McQueen's] Well, we'll talk later, Mater. [chuckles as he gets behind McQueen] "Later, Mater." That's funny! [McQueen screams. He uses his tow hook to grab McQueen's undercarriage]

09 - Traffic Court
Sheriff: [Then the screen skips to show the Radiator Springs Courthouse & Fire Department from outside as Sheriff's voice is heard.] The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order!
Ramone: [Then the screen shows inside the building as McQueen and Mater enter the courtroom, which most of the other Radiator Springs residents were inside and were angry with McQueen for what he have done from that night.] Hey, you scratched my paint! I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!
Luigi: [Then the screen shows McQueen as he moves his tire up while getting pushed by Mater into the courtroom to the accused space.] You broke-a the road! You a very bad car!
Fillmore: Fascist!
Sarge: Commie!
Lightning McQueen: [to Sheriff] Officer, talk to me, babe. How long is this gonna take? I gotta get to California, pronto.
Sheriff: Where's your lawyer?
Lightning McQueen: [scoffs] I don't know. Tahiti maybe. He's got a timeshare there.
Sheriff: When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him. [to the other residents] Hey! Anyone wanna be his lawyer? [All of the residents move back, except Mater.]
Mater: Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!
:[Mater moves beside McQueen]
Sheriff: All rise! The Honorable Doc Hudson presidin'.
Luigi: [Ramone moves his body up from his tires] Show Off.
Sheriff: May Doc have mercy on your soul.
:[The door bangs as Doc Hudson comes in, which the screen shows him from his side as he drives to his bench. McQueen gasps as he hears the door bang]
Doc Hudson: Alright, I wanna know who's responsible for wreckin' my town, Sheriff. I wanna his hood on a platter! I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots! No, check that. [McQueen gulps. He gets on some ramps that move him up to the top of his bench] I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him, and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot. I'm-- [notices McQueen, as McQueen does a nervous grin] Throw him outta here, Sheriff. I want him outta my courtroom. I want him outta our town! Case dismissed.
Lightning McQueen: Yes!
Mater: Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyerin' stuff.
Sally: [Then the door opens as Sally appears.] Sorry, I'm late, your honor!
Lightning McQueen: [McQueen and turn around to see her, which McQueen instantly falls in love with her.] [to himself McQueen whispers] Holy porsche! She's gotta be from my attorney's office! [Sally then drives into the courtroom as McQueen turn back to the front.] [to Sally] Hey, thanks for comin', we're all set. He's letting me go.
Sally: [stops, and turns to McQueen] He's letting you go?
Lightning McQueen: Yeah, your job's pretty easy today. All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you. Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Me, you, dinner. [reflects sunlight on his bolt sticker] Ka-chow! [The reflected sunlight shines on Sally's eyes; Sally groans, grunts] I know, I get that reaction a lot. I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand. [stops reflecting sunlight, revs his engine. Sally groans] Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
Mater: Well, a little bit, but I'll be alright.
Sally: OK, I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
Lightning McQueen: Do what you gotta do, baby. Oh, but listen, be careful. Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
Mater: [Then we see Mater, who is trying to reflect sunlight on his wing mirror like what McQueen did with his bolt sticker earlier.] Ka-ching! [Then the sunlight goes into his eyes.] [Mater groans]
Sally: [to McQueen] I'll keep that in mind. [to Mater] Hey, there, Mater.
Mater: Howdy, Sally. [Then McQueen's smile turn to frown.]
Sally: Hi, folks! [to the other Radiator Springs residents, drives to Doc]
Folks: Good morning, Sally!
Lightning McQueen: [to Mater] Do you know her?
Mater: She's the town attorney and my fiancee.
Lightning McQueen: What?
Mater: [chuckling, smacks McQueen with his tire] I'm just kiddin'. She just likes me for my body.
Sally: Doc, you look great this morning! Did you do something different with your side view mirrors?Doc Hudson: What do you want, Sally?
Sally: [Sally sighs] Come on, make this guy fix the road. The town needs this.
Doc Hudson: No. I know his type. Race car. That's the last thing this town needs.
Sally: OK, I didn't wanna have to do this, Doc. But you leave me no choice. [to the other citizens] Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history.
Doc Hudson: [to himself] Here she goes again.
Sally: Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road! It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers on our stretch of that road.
Sarge: [in voice] Travelers? What travelers?
Fillmore: [in voice] Ignore him.
Sally: But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on? [to Luigi] Luigi, what do you have at your store?
Luigi: Tires.
Sally: And if no one can get to you?
Luigi: I won't sell any.... tires. I will lose everything!
Sally: Flo, what do you have at your store?
Flo: I have gas. Lotsa gas! [Mater and Ramone laugh on a joke with gasoline and gas from farts]
Sally: OK, boys, stay with me. And, and, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?
Flo: I'll go outta business and we'll have to leave town!
Sally: And what's gonna happen to all of us if Flo leaves town and closes her station?
Folks: Without gas, we're done for!
Lizzie: What?
Sally: So, don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?
Lizzie: The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!
Ramone: Lizzie, the guy left, like, 15 years ago.
Lizzie: Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?
Sally: Oh, he can do it. He's got the horsepower. So, what do you want him to do?
Folks: Fix the road!
Sally: Because we are a town worth fixing!
Folks: Yeah! [all cheering]
Doc Hudson: [honks his own horn, which represents banging a hammer] Order in the court! Seems like my mind has been changed for me.
Folks: Yeah!
Lightning McQueen: No.
Fillmore: Nice rulin'.
Lightning McQueen: [groans to Sally] I am so not take you to dinner.
Sally: [giggles] That's OK, Stickers. You can take Bessie.
Mater: Oh, man, you got to work with Bessie, I'd give my left 2-Lug Nuts for somethin' like that!
Lightning McQueen: Bessie? Who's Bessie?

10 - Bessie
:[The screen then skips to outside, where we see Bessie, who is a road-paving machine that is not a living vehicle. Tar is heard gurgling. Doc is next to her, with McQueen and Mater.]
Doc Hudson: This here is Bessie, finest Road-Pavin' Machine ever built. [to McQueen] I'm hereby sentencing you to community service. You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.
Lightning McQueen: WHAT?! This place is crazy!
Mater: [whispers to McQueen] Hey, I know this may be a bad time right now, but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees.
Lightning McQueen: What?
Doc Hudson: [to McQueen] So we're gonna hitch you up to sweet Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice.
Lightning McQueen: You gotta be kidding me!
Doc Hudson: [to McQueen] You start there where the road begins, [drives to where the road begins from the courthouse] you finish down there where the road ends.
Mater: [Mater get onto the road, facing towards the end of the town, and has a long swirly crack. McQueen moves his tire up, and moves himself forward so he can move with his parking boot still on. Mater looking at the damaged road] HOLY SHOOT!!!
Lightning McQueen: Whoa, whoa, whoa! How long is this gonna take?!
Doc Hudson: Well, fella does it right, should take him about 5-days.
Lightning McQueen: 5-days? But I should be in California schmoozin' Dinoco right now!
Doc Hudson: Then if I were you, I'd quit yappin' and start workin'! Hook him up, Mater.
Mater: Okay-dokey. [Mater tries to get McQueen's parking boot off as watched him do that. Mater groaning. Finally, McQueen's boot comes off. Suddenly, he quickly move away and into the distance.]
Lightning McQueen: FREEDOM!!!!
Mater: [Doc crossly looked at Mater, who was shocked.] Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie...and then...then took the boot off. [looks at the team]
:[Then the screen shows McQueen driving away from Radiator Springs, even driving past a billboard saying "Leaving so soon?"]
Lightning McQueen: WHOO-HOO! Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie! California, here I come! Yeah! Oh, fell that wind! Yes! [Sheriff but then, he start sputtering.] No, no, no, no! Outta gas? How can I be outta gas?
Sheriff: [He stopped near the other billboard, where Sheriff and Sally are.] [laughs] Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are.
Lightning McQueen: [sputtering] But, but, but how did...? How did--? You--?
Sally: We siphoned your gas while you were passed out, [reflects sunlight on her wing mirror] KA-CHOW! [McQueen getting hit in the eyes by the reflected sunlight] [McQueen groans] [Sheriff laughing]
Sheriff: [The screen shows the traffic light, as its amber light continues blinking. Then we see Sheriff driving to Flo's V8 Cafe, where Fillmore and Sarge are standing.] Gentlemen.
Sarge: [The gas station bell dings.] Sheriff.
Fillmore: Hey, Sheriff.
Luigi: [Then the screen shows Luigi and Guido at Luigi's Casa Della Tires as they are arguing about where some tires were put at the moment and before. Red is watering some flowers there.] Why the tires are here?
Guido: [speaking Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.
Luigi: They were better well before.
Guido: Stai sempre a parlare.
Luigi: Guido!
Lizzie: [to Red] Red, can you move over? I want to get look at that sexy hot rod.
Mater: [While Lizzie was talking, Red stops watering. Then we see McQueen pulling Bessie slowly along the road between the many old closed shops, laying out tar behind Bessie. Mater was standing on the sidewalk and the whole of are with him.] Ya know, I used to be a purty good whistler. I can't do it now of course, on account of sometimes I get fluid built up in my engine block, but Doc said he's gonna fix it dough. He can fix about anything. That's why we made him the judge. Boy, you shoulda heard me on "giddy-up, oom papa mow mow." Now, I'm not one to brag, but people come purty far to see me get low on the mow-mow.
Lightning McQueen: [Then a bubble of tar comes out from one of Bessie's pipes, pops, and a little slob of tar lands on McQueen's right bolt sticker.] [McQuen gasps] Aw, man, that's just great!
Mater: Hey, what's wrong?
Lightning McQueen: My lucky sticker's all dirty.
Mater: [groans] That ain't nothin', I'll clean it for ya! [Mater snorts, and hacks]
Lightning McQueen: No, no, no! That wouldn't be necessary. [notices Red the fire truck, who was watering the same flowers at Luigi's store] Hey! Hey, big fella! Yeah, you in the red! [sees McQueen, and stops watering] I could use a little hose down. Help me wash this off. [But Red instead leaves nervously, pushing the flowers away.] What, where's he goin'?
Mater: Oh, he's still a little bit shy, and he hates you for killin' his flowers.
Lightning McQueen: I shouldn't have to put up with this! I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics!
Mater: You hurt your what?
Lightning McQueen: I'm a very famous race car!
:[Then Luigi and Guido come over.]
Luigi: You are a famous race car? A real race car?
Lightning McQueen: Yes, I'm a real race car. What do you think? Look at me.
Luigi: I have followed racin' my entire life of my whole life!
Lightning McQueen: Then you know who I am. I'm Lightning McQueen.
Luigi: Lightning McQueen!
Lightning McQueen: YES! YES!
Luigi: I must scream it to the world! My excitement from the top of someplace very high! Do you know many Ferraris?
Lightning McQueen: No, no, no. They race on the European circuit. I'm in the Piston Cup! [Then we see Luigi and Guido, who are now frowning.] What?
Luigi: Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
:[Luigi and Guido then drive back to their store. McQueen then gets saddened at not being known because of Luigi watching just the Ferrari racing.]

11 - Customers!
Flo: Is that what I think it is? [The camera then shows Van and Minny in the distance, driving towards the town.]
Sally: Customers. Customers! Customers, everyone! Customers! Okay!
Lizzie: Customers?
Sally: [Then, as Sally is talking, we see Luigi and Guido hearing Sally and are glad. Ramone then moves his body up. Mater gasps and drives to the crossroad. Sarge and Fillmore start driving to their stores.] All right, everybody calm down for a long time. Just remember what we rehearsed. Make sure your "Open, please come in" signs are out. And you all know what to do. All right, nobody panics. Here we go! [drives towards Van and Minny. The camera then shows Van and Minny driving along the road, as they are lost trying to find the Interstate.]
Minny: Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere.
Van: Minny, I know exactly where we are.
Minny: Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.
Van: Honey, please.
:[Then Sally appears in front of them.]
Sally: Hello. Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley. Legendary for it's quality service and friendly hospitality. How can we help you?
Van: We don't need anything, thank you very much. [drives past Sally, to Van]
Minny: Whoa, honey ask her direction to the Interstate. [drives along, while Sally follows. As Van and Minny drive along the road, they drive alongside the bumps caused by Stanley's statue.]
Van: There's no need to ask for directions. Minny, I know exactly where we're going.
Minny: [to Sally] He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee. You know, we were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we...
Van: [chuckles] OK, OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
Fillmore: What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel.
Van: [chuckles] No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
Minny: We're just tryin' to find the Interstate.
Sarge: Good to see you, Soldier! Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for all your government surplus needs.
Minny: Oh, honey, surplus!
Van: I think we have too much surplus.
Sally: I do have a map over the Cozy Cone Motel. And if you do stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast.
Minny: Honey, she's got a map.
Van: I don't need a map! I have the GPS. Never need a map again, thank you.
Flo: How 'bout somethin' to drink? Stop at Flo's V8 Cafe. Finest fuel on Route 66.
Van: No, we just top off.
Luigi: [juggles tires while Luigi is talking, and ends with most of them in a pile with one standing up on top] And if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires, home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
Minny: We're just tryin' to find the Interstate.
Ramone: But you do need a paint job man. Ramone will paint you up right. Hey, anything you want! You know, like a flame job.
Minny: No, thanks...
Ramone: Maybe ghost flames! You like old school pinstripin'? Von Dutch style ha? [lifts his rear end up in front in Van and Minny gasping]
Minny: Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.
Van: [laughs] OK, now. [chuckles, and starts to drive away along with Minny] We're gonna be going now, OK? [Then Lizzie puts a bumper sticker attached to her tire onto Van's rear bumper. Van grunts and turns around towards Lizzie]
Lizzie: [laughing] A little somethin' to remember us by, OK?
Van: [laughs] OK! [drives away along with Minny]
Sally: Come back soon, OK? I mean, you know where we are! [giggles] Tell your friends!
Van: [Then the camera does a close-up of the bumper sticker, which shows Willy's Butte and a message saying "Nice Butte - Radiator Springs", and zooms out. Van chuckles] OK! Yes. You bet.
Minny: Thanks again, folks. Bye-bye now.
Lightning McQueen: Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey, hey,hey! I know how to get to the Interstate!
Minny: Oh, do ya?
Van: Minny, no.
Lightning McQueen: Yeah, yeah,yeah. No, not really. But listen. I'm Lightning McQueen, the famous race car. I'm being held heren against my will. [Van then grins as Minny smiles at McQueen.] And I need you to call my team, so they can rescue me, and get me to California in time for me to win The Piston Cup. Do you understand?
:[Van and Minny just stand for about three seconds of silence. Then their locks beep, their smiles turn to frowns, and they just leave.]
Lightning McQueen: No, no, no, no, no! No, It's the truth! I'm tellin' you! You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!! I'm in hillbilly hell!! My IQ's dropping by the second!! I'M BECOMING ONE OF 'EM!!!
Sally: [Van and Minny disappear as McQueen yells, and "them" is echoed. Sally sighs, and then talks to the other residents] OK, don't worry. They know where we are now. They're gonna tell their friends. You'll see.
Radio: And we'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...
Sally: That's good. [as the other residents drive away]
Radio: [through the radio] ...after a Piston Cup update. Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Meanwhile, Chick Hicks arrived in California and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.
Chick: [through the radio] Yeah, well it's just nice to get out here before the other competitors. Ya know, get a head start. Gives me an edge.
:[McQueen is then shocked as Chick talks. Electronic music plays as he daydreams of Chick instead being sponsored by Dinoco. First, we see Chick in front of Dinoco's stage touching Tex Dinoco with his tire, as the camera zooms out to show them and the Dinoco gang at the Los Angeles International Speedway laughing. Then we see Chick overtaking The King in the race, as The King is shocked, as he overtakes The King. Chick then crosses the finish line, and we then see him with his trophy and two Dinoco girls beside him. Then it shows his paint being changed to blue, removing most of his decals and replacing the Hostile Tank over Bank logo with Dinoco's. It shows the text saying "The new face of" above Chick and Tex before the text "Dinoco" covers the other text. Then the screen shows the text "The King" changing to a logo of Chick with the text "Chick" and zooming out to show the Dinoco helicopter Rotor Turbo sky winking on top of the stage with pictures of Chick all over it along with his name and the text "Chick likes Dinoco". It then shows Chick posing in the same studio as with McQueen in his previous daydream. Then it shows Chick on the covers of the same magazines, and then it shows him with Mia and Tia in Dinoco paint on the same red carpet being surrounded by the same cheering crowd. Then it shows the text "Chick Thunder Hicks". It shows Chick flying through the air. Then the screen shows two magnets pulled together and the text "Chick Magnet" Then it shows Chick inside the same building near the Hollywood Sign, which he is between Mia and Tia painted gold. Mia and Tia chatter and giggle and then we see Mia and Tia pulled towards Chick like a magnet.]
Chick: Yeah! Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out.
Lightning McQueen: [Then McQueen's daydream ends as the screen shows the present day. McQueen gasps] Oh! Mater, let me get this straight. I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right?
Mater: That's what they done did said.
Lightning McQueen: OK. Outta my way. I got a road to finished. [The screen then zooms in on two "End Construction Zone" signs in the distance. McQueen grunts and revs his engine. McQueen starts to move at his normal speed. Bits of tar come out of Bessie as McQueen drives faster. Mater is then shocked at seeing him move.]
Mater: [Then the camera shows inside Doc Hudson's office as Mater comes in] He's done!
Doc Hudson: Done?
Mater: [nobs his face] Ahmhm.
Doc Hudson: It's only been an hour.
:[Then we see McQueen at the end of the construction zone, glad at laying tar across the whole road as the other residents are standing in front of him and looking shocked. Bessie groans]
Lightning McQueen: I'm done. Look, I'm finished. Just say thank you, and I'll be on my way. That's all I gotta say.
Mater: [Then the camera moves up into the air and shows the new road which now looks incredibly bumpy and sloppy. Mater is seen beside it in the distance.] WHOO HOO! I'm the first one on the new road! UH OH! [drives onto the road, and vibrates as he moves over the bumpy tar, and several objects fall off him] It rides purty smooth. [continues vibrating]
Sally: It looks awful!
Lightning McQueen: Well, it matches the rest of the town.
Sally: Oh!
:[Red blubbers, sobs, and drives away]
Sally: Red?
:[Red continues sobbing, and disappears as he drives around the impound, knocking over a pile of tires. Sally then Angrily turns to McQueen.]
Sally: Who do you think you are?
Lightning McQueen: Look! Doc said when I finish, I could go! That was the deal!
Doc Hudson: [driving up] The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse. Now, scrape it off! Start over again.
Lightning McQueen: Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a race car.
Doc Hudson: Ho,ho,ho! Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you.
Sally: What?
Lightning McQueen: [chuckles] Me and you. Is that a joke?
Doc Hudson: If you win, you go and I fix the road. If I win, you do the road my way.
Sheriff: Doc, what're you doin'?
Lightning McQueen: [laughs] I don't mean to be rude here Doc, but you probably go zero to sixty in like what? Three-point-five years?
Doc Hudson: Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
Lightning McQueen: You know what old timer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

12 - Doc's Challenge
:[Then the screen shows the sky, and moves down to show McQueen and Doc Hudson on a dirt road near which is a rock resembling the landmark of and a classic Pontiac hood ornament. Sheriff is front of them, telling them the rules. The other Radiator Springs residents and the whole of are seen attending. Luigi and Guido are wearing Ferrari merchandise, excited with watching a race. Luigi is waving a Ferrari flag on his antenna. McQueen is making small jumps to the left and right, and stretching his tires.]
Sheriff: Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race. You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back. There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin', no bittin', no road rage, no maimin', no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no back-stabbin', no road-hoggin' and no lollygaggin'.
Lightning McQueen: [whispering] Speed. I'm speed. Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.
Luigi: [laughing] My friend Guido, he dream to give a real race car a pit stop!
Guido: [turns up] Pit stop!
Lightning McQueen: [groans, chuckles] The race is only one lap, guys. Uno lappo! [Luigi's smile then turns to a frown, while Guido is still shaking happily.] Don't need any help. I work solo mio.
Luigi: Fine. Race your way. [drives away to join the others, Guido is still standing there shaking happily.]
Lightning McQueen: No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
Guido: OK. [drives away to join the others]
Sheriff: Gentlemen. Start your engines!
:[Doc Hudson starts his engine, which sputters, and smoke puffs out of his tailpipe. Then McQueen revs his engine furiously.]
Ramone: Hijole! Check that out!
Fillmore: Whoa.
Flo: Emm, emm.
Sally: Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done.
Sheriff: Luigi? [then he joins the others as Luigi drives onto the road with his Ferrari flag to start the race.]
Luigi: [chuckling] On your mark, get set. Uno for the money, due for the show, tre to get ready, and quattro to... [While Luigi is talking, the screen does a closeup of McQueen and Doc's eyes. McQueen's eyes move towards Doc, whose eyes look furious. Luigi as McQueen revs his engine] I can't believe it... [waves his flag] Go!! [McQueen then starts off, and races towards Willy's Butte and leaving a pile of dust. Luigi laughs]
Doc Hudson: Yee ha! Ha ha ha!
Sally: Yeah.
Luigi: Huh? [As the dust clears, we see that Doc is still there, not moving.] Doc, the flag means go. Remember the flag. Here we go. Go. [But Doc is still not moving.]
Ramone: Um... Doc, what are you doin', man?
Doc Hudson: Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start. Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater. Might need a little help.
Mater: Um, okay. [drives alongside Doc]
Doc Hudson: You got your tow cable?
Mater: [showing his tow cable] Well, yeah. I always got my tow cable. Why?
Doc Hudson: Oh, just in case.
:[Then we see McQueen driving around the first curve, and towards the final turn. His front wheels turn left, but he then gets shocked as instead of going left, he went right, fell off the side and towards a cactus patch in the valley.]
Lightning McQueen: [screams] AH, OW, OW, OW, OW, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!! [hits the cacti]
Ramone: Oh, man! Ow!
Fillmore: Whoa. Bad trip, man.
Doc Hudson: [McQueen tries to reverse out of the cactus, but he couldn't budge. Then Doc and Mater turn up to the cliff.] Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac or was that stingin' like a Beemer? I'm confused.
Mater: [chuckles]
Doc Hudson: You drive like you fix roads. [McQueen's frowns angrily] Lousy! [to Mater] Have fun fishin', Mater. [drives off]
Lightning McQueen: [Mater swings his tow cable, and throws his hook towards McQueen, which it grabs onto his rear end. McQueen gasps and Mater then pulls McQueen out of the cactus.]
Mater: I'm startin' to think he knowed you was gonna crash!
Lightning McQueen: [as he gets pulled up the side of the valley] Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
:[Then the screen shows McQueen scraping the tar off the road with a shovel, as the other residents and watch him.]
Lightning McQueen: I can make a little turn on dirt. You think? [grunts as he scrapes another bit of tar] No. And now I'm a day behind. I'm never gonna get outta here!
Ramone: Hey, ese! You need a new paint job, man!
Lightning McQueen: No, thank you.
Fillmore: How 'bout some organic fuel?
Sarge: That freak juice?
Lightning McQueen: Pass.
Flo: Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty. [to Mater] Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
Mater: Nah, not me, Flo. I'm on one of 'em there special diets. [a few bits of spit comes out of him as he says "special"] I'm a precisional instrument of speed and air-matics.
Lightning McQueen: "You race like you fix roads." [groaning] I'll show him. [groaning again] I will show him! [Then the screen shows at night time as Doc drives towards his building named Doctor Hudson: Dr. of Internal Combustion. He then looks to the right, which we see McQueen pulling Bessie at the start, while Sheriff is watching him with his magnetic beacon on. Laughing sounds are made by Bessie's engine as tar splats on McQueen shaking the tar off.] Aw, great!! I hate it!! Hate, hate, hate, hate it!!!
Doc Hudson: [chuckles] Music. Sweet music. [drives into his building]
Sally: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Lightning McQueen: Radiator Springs, a happy place!!
Bessie: [clucking] [Sally drives into her building at the Cozy Cone Motel as the rest of all go into their tents to try to get some sleep despite fart noises and McQueen's very loud complaining]
Lightning McQueen: [Then another slop of tar lands on McQueen.] Whoa, OK, Bessie you think that funny?! Great!! I'm talkin' to Bessie now!! I'm talkin' to Bessie!!!
Mater: [Then the screen shows the next morning, and moves down to Sally exiting her building and the whole of all coming out of their tents, all dressed in their regular outfits. Then, they all hear Mater, who is heard laughing and cheering.]

13 - A New Road
Sally: Wow! [She and the team then went to the crossroad, to which it is then shown that there is flat tarmac on the part of the road from the courthouse to the end of the crossroad. Mater driving around on the tarmac]
Mater: Mornin', Sally! Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!
Sally: Yes! Ahmm. Amazing! [Luigi and Guido are also seen, impressed at the new tarmac. Then we see Ramone, who has changed his paint from purple to green. Ramone driving on the new tarmac, lifts his front up]
Ramone: Yeah! [sighs and moves his front back down]
Flo: Oh, Ramone, Mama ain't seen you that low in years.
Ramone: I haven't seen a road like this in years.
Flo: Well, then let's cruise, baby.
Ramone: Low and slow.
Luigi: [speaking Italian] E Bellissima! It's beautiful! Guido, look, it's a like it was paved by angels. Oh!!
Mater: Oh, I tell you what. I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.
Sally: Doc, look at this! Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
Doc Hudson: Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go.
:[Sally, Doc and then turn around, as we notice that McQueen still has the pave the rest of the road. Then the screen shows all of the other residents driving on the tarmac. Luigi is being towed by Mater.]
Luigi: Guido, look at Luigi! [Mater lets go, and Luigi slides across the tarmac at the crossroad. Luigi driving back and forth once across the tarmac, Luigi chuckling] This is fantastico!
Sally: That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
Lizzie: Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump.
Luigi: [groans] That crazy old devil woman. [sighs as he and Guido get shocked at the look of their store] She's right!
Sally: [shrieks and sliding along the tarmac and back the other way]
Luigi: Guido!

14 - Turn Right to Go Left
Doc Hudson: Huh! That punk actually did a good jab. [noticing Bessie on the other road] Well, now... where the hack is he? [Then the screen shows Lightning McQueen in the desert driving on the same dirt road used for the race track. Doc then comes to Sheriff, who was watching McQueen.] Sheriff! Is he makin' another run for it?
Sheriff: No, no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night, asked me if he could come down here. All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn.
Lightning McQueen: [slides off the track and onto the dirt] NO NO NO NO! Aw, great! [Doc laughs and driving back onto the track] Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.
Doc Hudson: Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's. I'll keep an eye on him.
Sheriff: Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feelin' a quart low. [drives back to Radiator Springs]
:[We then see McQueen again, with his engine revs as he still tries to make the final turn. But again, he slides off the track onto the dirt.]
Lightning McQueen: AAH!!!!!
:[His side moves towards the camera, which dust fills the screen. When it clears, we see McQueen with a tumbleweed on his head and McQueen spits dust out. Doc then appears in front of him as he moves the tumbleweed off.]
Doc Hudson: This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
Lightning McQueen: Oh, great. What do you want? You hear to gloat? [drives past slowly]
Doc Hudson: You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you gotta pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle. Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips.
Lightning McQueen: [turns around] So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert.
Doc Hudson: I'll put it simple. If you goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.
Lightning McQueen: Ooh, right, that makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you! Or should I say, "No thank you"? Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, "Thank you"! [his smile turns to a frown, then he starts his engine and drives off, McQueen scoffs] Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
Doc Hudson: [groans as he then drives away slowly back to Radiator Springs with his feelings hurt by McQueen.]
:[Then we see McQueen driving around the first corner, and he looks towards Doc driving off.]
Lightning McQueen: Turn right to go left. [to Doc, drives away slowly back to Radiator Springs] Mm... [He moves his front wheels right, but he then suddenly went right.] OH! [He then drives off the side, stays still in midair for a second, and falls down into the valley.] WHOA! [McQueen winds up in another cactus patch] OW! Oh, that-- [Then, a cactus falls and crashes on top of McQueen.] OW!!!!

15 - Back to Work
:[The screen shows McQueen, covered with little bits of cactus around him, as he continues pulling Bessie along the road, while "Find Yourself" is playing.]
Lightning McQueen: Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it. You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right!
Lizzie: You keep talkin' to yourself, people'll think you crazy!
Lightning McQueen: Thanks for the tip.
Lizzie: What? I wasn't talkin' to you!
:[Then the screen shows Luigi and Guido as they decorate their store, with helping them. Luigi is cleaning the windows from inside while are cleaning the windows from outside, while Guido is holding two rollers dipped in green paint from two trays and paints the wall beneath the windows. Sally then comes to them.]
Sally: Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
Guido: Che cosa?
Sally: It looks great! This is great!
Guido: Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.
:[Luigi then comes out, happy on Sally's comments. Meanwhile, Mater uses his hook to get the "Mater Towing & Salvage" sign upright while and watch him.]
Mater: [groans as he pulls his sign upright, then passes gas] Oh, Lord! [Then the sign tilts to the other side. Mater laughs] Huh?
Sheriff: Mater?! I need you to watch the prisoner tonight.
Mater: Well, Dad Gum! Wait a minute, what if he tries to run again?
Sheriff: Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back. But keep an eye on him.
Mater: Yes, sir! [closes one eye, and keeps the other open] Unh!
:[Sheriff sighs and drives away]
Lightning McQueen: While I'm stuck here pavin' this stinkin' road, Chick's in california schmoozin' dinoco. My dinoco! [feels something] WHOA WHOA WHOA! Who's touchin' me?! [Guido then pops up beside him. He was spinning each of McQueen's tires to get the cactus bits off them, and uses a spray can on the tires.]
Luigi: You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix. You make a such a nice new road. You come to my shop. Luigi take a good care of you. Even though you not a Ferrari. [to McQueen] You buy four tires, I give you a full size spare absolutely free!
Lightning McQueen: Look, I get all my tires for free.
Luigi: [chuckles and gasps] I like your style, Eu? You drive the hard bargain. Okay, Luigi make you a new deal. You buy one tire, I give you three for free! [The screen shows Sally watching them, then she turns around to see Flo amazed with Ramone cleaning a fence around a house beside Ramone's House of Body Art.]
Flo: Aw... Would you look at that? Ramone, Ramone!
Ramone: [chuckles]
Luigi: Then Luigi make you a new deal.
:[Sally then looks towards Red cleaning the Leaning Tower of Tires with his water, while McQueen and Luigi continue talking.]
Lightning McQueen: No, no, no, no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you. [The screen then shows McQueen, Luigi, Guido.]
Luigi: No, no, no, no, no. This is it, my last offer. You buy one tire, I give you 7-a snow tire for all free! Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am.
:[Luigi and Guido then leave. McQueen exhales deeply. Suddenly, a burst of water is shot out at McQueen, causing most of the cactus pieces on him to come off.]
Lightning McQueen: Stop! Let me--! [Then the water stops, as McQueen coughs. The screen then turns around to show Sally and Red, who was shooting water at McQueen to get him clean.]
Sally: [noticing a cactus piece on McQueen's hood] Oh, Red! You missed a spot, see it right there? On the hood right there.
Lightning McQueen: No, no!
:[Red then starts shooting water at McQueen again, struggling to get the cactus piece off McQueen's hood.]
Lightning McQueen: NO! Stop! Stop! That cold! Help! Please stop! [Finally, the cactus piece comes off, and Red stops. McQueen coughs and sputters]
Sally: Thanks, Red. [Red then leaves.]
Lightning McQueen: What was that for?!
Sally: Do you wanna stay at the Cozy Cone or what?
Lightning McQueen: Huh?
Sally: And if you do, you gotta be clean. 'Cause even here in hillibilly hell we have standards.
Lightning McQueen: What, I--? I don't get it.
Sally: Nothin'. I just thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job. So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me! But there. Not with me there, but there in your own Cozy Cone. And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
Lightning McQueen: Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
Sally: I mean if you wanna stay at the dirty impound, thats, thats fine. You know, I understand you criminal types.
Lightning McQueen: No, no, no, no. That's okay. Yeah, the Cozy Cone. [looks at the Cozy Cone Motel]
Sally: Eu, it's newly refurbished.
Lightning McQueen: [chuckles] Yeah, it's like a clever little twist the motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars usually try to avoid, now we're gonna stay in 'em. [chuckles] That's funny.
Sally: Figure that all out on your own, did you? [reverses and turns around, drives back to the motel] Cone number one, if you want.
Lightning McQueen: [groans and notices a tattoo on Sally's back] Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?
Sally: OH! [turns around and giggles, then reverses] That's just a-- [bumps into a pile of cones, with one on her roof] OH! [McQueen and Sally laughing] Oh, You saw that? [giggles] Yeah! Just gonna be going. [reverses to the door of the building] Gonna... [the cone on her roof comes off as it hits the door] Yeah. [McQueen then grins. The screen then zooms out to show Mater next to them.]
Mater: [McQueen gasps as Mater starts talking] You know, I once knew this girl doreen. Good-lookin' girl! Looked just like a jaguar, only she was a truck! You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her!
Lightning McQueen: What are you talking about?
Mater: I don't know. Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watchin' ya!
Lightning McQueen: No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here.
Mater: Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt. You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
Lightning McQueen: Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater. Ya know who you're talkin' to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything.

16 - Tractor Tipping
:[Then the screen shows McQueen and beside Mater on top of a hill at night.]
Lightning McQueen: [Whispers] Mater, I'm not doin' this.
Mater: Aw, come on, you'll love it! [Mater chuckles. The screen then shows a field full of sleeping tractors.] Tractor-tippin's fun!
Lightning McQueen: [Tractors snoring] This is ridiculous.
Mater: [to McQueen] Alright, listen, when I say go, we go, but don't let Frank catch you, GO! [drives towards the field]
Lightning McQueen: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, Wait, Wait! W--Wh--Who's Frank? [Mater continues driving, and enters the field. McQueen whispering] Mater! Wait, Mater! [McQueen and the whole team then follow Mater.]
Mater: Okay, here's what you do, you just sneak up in front of them, and then honk? And they do the rest. Watch this. [tiptoes towards a tractor, and honks his horn loudly. Tractor 1 wakes up. Leans up and moos, then lands on its back. Then gas is heard sloshing, and the tractor backfires, which it sounded like farting. Mater laughs loudly]
Mater: I swear, tractors is so dumb! I tell you what, buddy, you don't get much better than this.
Lightning McQueen: Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.
:[Then Mater drives away towards another tractor, jumps up into the air, lands back on the ground, and honks his horn. Tractor 2 wakes up. Leans up, moos, and lands on its back. Mater then drives back to McQueen and the team, and poses himself for the tractor's gas sloshing and the backfiring. Mater laughs again.]
Mater: I don't care who you are, that's funny right there. [to the team, to McQueen] Ah, you turn, bud.
Lightning McQueen: Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn.
Mater: Baby?
Lightning McQueen: I'm not a baby!
Mater: [clucking]
Lightning McQueen: [to Mater] Fine. Stop, Stop, Okay? Alright, I'll do something.
:[Then the screen shows McQueen driving slowly towards a tractor. He stops in front of it, and just watches. Tractor 3 snores, McQueen looks shocked, then he looks towards and Mater, who grins and moves his tire towards the tractor. The camera then shows from beneath the tractor's undercarriage as McQueen gets prepared to do something. The screen then does a close-up on McQueen as he revs his engine loudly. Tractor 3 wakes up. Then all of the other tractors wake up. Tractors exclaim, and lean up all land on their backs. Then the tractors gurgle as Mater, McQueen and look toward each other. Then the tractors all backfire, one by one. After one second, the last tractor remaining backfires. Then Mater, McQueen laugh. Then an angry moo is heard in the distance as they both stop laughing. The screen then turns to show a bush, and some lights from behind as another moo is heard.]
Mater: ... That's Frank. [drives away, while our heroes are standing still]
:[Then the bushes get shredded as Frank, a combine harvester appears and notices our heroes. Frank bellows angrily]
Lightning McQueen: [Screams]
:[Our non-vehicle heroes run and fly away, while the vehicle heroes rev their engines, turn around and drive away quickly as Frank chases them. Frank bellows. Frank gets closer to McQueen, who then goes faster as he notices. Our heroes then catch up to Mater, who is laughing.]
Mater: RUN!!! [continues laughing. Then the screen zooms out to show them heading towards the fence. Our heroes then turn to the left as Frank continues chasing them. Frank bellowing, Mater laughing. Frank is then seen from his side as he gains on McQueen.] Run, he's gonna get ya! [The screen then shows from McQueen' point of view as they all come towards another end of the field where there was one piece in the fence, and Mater with McQueen drive through it. McQueen screams and Frank stops as he comes towards the edge of the field, and McQueen stop and then drive away on the road with Mater back to Radiator Springs. Mater laughing]
Sally: [Then the screen shows Sally inside the Cozy Cone Motel. Shadows then appear moving on the wall. Sally gasping and notices the shadows] Customers! [drives towards the door, turns on the neon lights, and notices a light saying "no" going off and coming back on, turns the lights off, turns the lights on again, but the "no" light was on before and turned off when the other lights turned on. Then we see Mater, McQueen and in the distance driving, walking and fluttering along the road.]
Mater: Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghost light!
Lightning McQueen: I can't wait, Mater.
Mater: Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya! [As Mater talks, the screen shows Sally, who notices them, sighs, grins and drives back into the building. Then the screen shows Mater, McQueen and the team again.] Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was fun!
Lightning McQueen: Oh, Yeah Yeah.
Mater: Well, we better get you back to the impound lot.
Lightning McQueen: Ya know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.
Mater: Aw. Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
Lightning McQueen: Oh, co-No, No, Are you kidding? Besides, she can't stand me. [McQueen scoffs] And I don't like her, to be honest.
Mater: Yeah, you probably right: "HEY, LOOK, THERE'S MISS SALLY!"
Lightning McQueen: [looking around] Where-Where?!
Mater: [laughing] [McQueen groans] You're in love with Miss Sally!
Lightning McQueen: [As our heroes are talking, Sally then turns to see them from inside the building.] No, I'm not.
Mater: Yes, you do.
Lightning McQueen: No way.
Mater: Way.
Lightning McQueen: Come on, look...
Mater: [turns around and drives backwards] You're in love with Miss Sally! You're in love with Miss Sally!
Lightning McQueen: Okay, that's real mature Mater, real grown up.
Mater: You love her! You love her, you love her! You love her, You love her, You love her!
Lightning McQueen: Wait... Alright, okay, Mater, Mater, Mater, no! [Mater laughs and noticing Mater driving backwards] Will you stop that?!
Mater: Stop what?
Lightning McQueen: That's drivin' backwards stuff. It's creeping me out. You're gonna wreck on somethin'.

17 - Backwards Driving
Mater: [stops moving] Wreck?! Shoot, I'm the world's best backwards driver! You just watch this right here, lover boy. [drives backwards with his lights on, drives towards one of the Cozy Cones]
Lightning McQueen: What are you doing?! Watch out, Look out! Mater?! [Mater then drives around the cone.] Mater! [Mater laughs as he drives around a few more cones] Mater! [Sally watches as Mater drives around the building. Finally, Mater drives backwards onto the desert ground, stops, and starts spinning.] Hey, take it easy, Mater!
Mater: [screams happily. Then Mater stops spinning, and drives backwards into the forest, laughing. Mater grunting and blubbering, and jumps high up into the air in front of the full orange Moon]
Lightning McQueen: [Laughs] He's nuts!
Mater: [driving back to McQueen and while still going backwards] No need to watch where I'm goin'! [jumps and turns around as he stops in front of McQueen] Just need to know where I've been. [turns his lights off]
Lightning McQueen: Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that?
Mater: Rear view mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want.
Lightning McQueen: [chuckles] Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race. [drives along]
Mater: What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?
Lightning McQueen: [stops moving, and turns around] It's not just a race. We're talkin' about the Piston Cup! I've been dreamin' about it my whole life! I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it. And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters. No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars.
Mater: What's wrong with rusty old cars?
Lightning McQueen: Well, I don't mean you, Mater. I mean other old cars. Ya know? Not like you. I like you.
Mater: It's OK, buddy. [to McQueen] Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters? I mean, I've always wanted to ride in one of 'em fancy helicopters.
Lightning McQueen: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
Mater: You mean it?
Lightning McQueen: Oh, yeah. Anything you'd say.
Mater: I knew it. I knowed I made a good choice!
Lightning McQueen: In what?
Mater: My best friend.
:[Then McQueen smile at this.]
Mater: See ya tomorrow, buddy! [Mater then turns on his lights, swings his hook, and drives backwards around McQueen and back to his home. Mater singing as he drives backwards] McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree, K-i-s somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!

18 - Goodnight
Lightning McQueen: [McQueen laughs. Then the team walk, flutter and drive toward the Cozy Cones, as McQueen tries to go backwards and looks behind.] Whoa, whoa, whoa. [We then see Sally as she watches them all going to their Cozy Cones.] Now then... [looks around to find his cone] Number 1, number 1! [finds Cone number one] Oh, Number 1! [drives into the cone and looks around as Sally comes to him.] Ha, this is nice.
Sally: Hey, Stickers! [McQueen screams and Sally shrieks] I'm sorry!
Lightning McQueen: [turns around] Whoq! You scared me, you gotta be careful.
Sally: I scared myself scarin' ya scaring me.
Lightning McQueen: I mean, I wasn't like "scared" scared.
Sally: No, of course not. Not.
Lightning McQueen: I was more...
Sally: Just I overheard you talkin' to Mater.
Lightning McQueen: When? Just, just now? What, what did, what did you hear?
Sally: Oh, just something about a helicopter ride.
Lightning McQueen: Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got a kick outta that, didn't he?
Sally: Did you mean it?
Lightning McQueen: What?
Sally: That you'll get him a ride.
Lightning McQueen: Oh, who knows? I mean first things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race.
Sally: Uh-huh. You know Mater trusts you.
Lightning McQueen: Yeah, OK.
Sally: Did you mean that?
Lightning McQueen: What?
Sally: Was it just a "Yeah, OK", or "Yeah...OK" or"Yea-yeah, OK"?
Lightning McQueen: Look, I'm exhausted. It's kinda been a long day.
Sally: Yeah, okay. Good night. [turns around and drives back to the building]
Lightning McQueen: [McQueen grunts as he remembers what asked him to do] Ah... Hey, thank you.
Sally: [Sally then stops, and turns around.] What did you just say?
Lightning McQueen: Ya know, thanks for lettin' me stay here. It's nice to be out of the impound, and this is... It's great. Newly refurbished, right?
Sally: Yeah.
Lightning McQueen: Good night.
Sally: Good night. [drives back to her building, Sally giggles. Then McQueen presses a button to close the door on the cone.]
:[The next morning, we hear an off-screen rooster crowing and we see the United States flag moving up to the top of a pole as a reveille plays. The screen then changes shot to the ground to show Sarge, who had raised the flag up.]
Sarge: [salutes with his antenna. Then Sarge's bugle reveille gets interrupted by Jimi Hendrix's rendition of "The Star-Strangled Banner" being put on by Fillmore.] Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!
Fillmore: Respect the classics, man. It's Hendrix.
:[Then the screen shows inside McQueen's cone, where he is still sleeping. McQueen groans, then breathes rapidly and mutters. Fast-paced electronic music plays as McQueen mutters, which it is shown that McQueen was dreaming of competing in the final race with The King and Chick, only that it was actually the Motor Speedway of the South circuit, not the Los Angeles International Speedway. Suddenly, Frank appears on the track, driving behind the three racers. Frank growling and Chick screaming. All three racers get shocked at seeing Frank. The King drives off the track, gets shredded by Frank's shredders. Then McQueen slides off the track. Frank crosses the finish line as the camera zooms in on Dexter Hoover's checkered flag and shows Frank on stage with his Piston Cup trophy, Tex and the Dinoco Girls. Two of the Dinoco Girls, who are on trophy models with discs on top, kiss Frank on his cheeks. Frank screaming loudly. Then the screen shows McQueen being surrounded by tractors, which one of them licks him. Tractor mooing. Then the screen shows back in the present, where McQueen wakes up from his dream.]
Lightning McQueen: No! [gasping] [Then an alarm beeps as a model car pops in and out of a miniature cone alarm clock.] I gotta get outta here! Hey, have you seen the Sheriff? [The screen shows inside Doc Hudson's building as McQueen and come in, notices Sheriff's rear, as Sheriff is on a ramp up in the air] Oh! Oh, my gosh. Oh!
Doc Hudson: [The screen turns around as it shows that Doc Hudson was sorting something on Sheriff's undercarriage. Doc turns around] Hey, what are you doing?!
Sheriff: Get a good peak, City Boy?
Lightning McQueen: [Stutters] I, a.. a.. I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
Doc Hudson: [angrily] Wait for him at Flo's! Now get outta here!
Lightning McQueen: I'VE BEEN TRYIN' TO GET OUTTA HERE FOR 3 DAYS! [McQueen and then leave the building.]

19 - Doc's Piston Cups
Sheriff: Hope you enjoyed the show! [McQueen grunts in anger as he kicks a can, which goes into a garage in the side of Doc Hudson's building, and we hear the sounds of objects falling down. McQueen and the team stop moving as they hear this. McQueen groans. Then the screen shows inside the garage as McQueen opens the doors, and he and the whole of enter. McQueen notices all of the boxes on the floor beside him]
Lightning McQueen: [Chuckling] Whoa ho, Doc. Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on. [Then McQueen notice something near the window. They turn towards it, and it turns out to be a Piston Cup trophy. They look up to see that the text on the bottom says "Hudson Hornet, Champion, 1951".] What? He has a Piston Cup? [Then they look to see another Piston Cup trophy behind a few boxes. They push the boxes aside, and see a third trophy as well along with four old racing tires with red hubcaps.] Oh, my gosh. Three Piston Cup? [They look at the text on the two trophies, which say that Doc was the champion of 1952 and 1953. Then they look to see a newspaper beside saying "Third Piston Cup Win! Hudson Hornet champion for all time" and showing a picture of Doc with the racing number 51 and the text "Fabulous Hudson Hornet" and a few other decals.]
Doc Hudson: Sign says stay out! [McQueen gasps upon hearing Doc's voice]
Lightning McQueen: [They all reverse and see Doc standing grumpily outside the door.]You You have three Piston Cups. How could you have--? [Doc drives in]
Doc Hudson: I knew you couldn't drive. I didn't know you couldn't read. [as Doc pushes McQueen outside]
Lightning McQueen: You're the Hudson Hornet!
Doc Hudson: Wait over at Flo's, like I told you!!
Lightning McQueen: Of course. I can't believe I didn't see it before! You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet! You still to hold the record for most wins in single season! Oh, we gotta talk. You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
Doc Hudson: I already tried that.
Lightning McQueen: And you won the championship three times! Look at those trophies!
Doc Hudson: You look. All I see is a bunch of empty cups. [closes the doors. McQueen frowns]

20 - Breakfast at Flo's
:["Behind the Clouds" plays as the screen shows the other residents, except Ramone and Sally, at Flo's V8 Cafe.]
Fillmore: Ya know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man.
Sarge: Oh, take a car wash, hippie.
Flo: Yeah, look at my husband, y'all. WHOO! That's your color!
:[Ramone shows up while Flo is talking, having yellow paint and a bit of purple and his orange and yellow flame on his sides.]
Ramone: Yellow, baby. [chuckles]
Flo: Mm! You smokin' hot!
Sheriff: [noticing McQueen and come towards them] There he is!
Lightning McQueen: Oh My Gosh! Did you know Doc is a famous race-car?!
Folks: [All of the residents stay silent for a few seconds, then all of them except Sheriff laugh.]
Sheriff: Doc? Our Doc?
Sarge: Not Doc Hudson.
:[The screen shows inside Doc Hudson's garage as he then grumpily watches the conversation outside.]
Lightning McQueen: No no no no no, it's true! He's a real racing legend. He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
Flo: Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour. I mean, have you ever seen him race?
Lightning McQueen: No, but I wish I could've. They say he was amazin', he wins three Piston Cups!
Mater: [spits out on his drink] He did what in his cup?
Sheriff: I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy!
Lizzie: Well, I'll say! Look how red he is! [McQueen frowns]
Ramone: Yeah, I think he needs a new coat of poly, man.
Mater: Are you sick, buddy?
Sheriff: You are lookin' a little peaked.
Ramone: Yeah, he needs a new coat of poly for sure!
:[Then the screen shows Sally pressing a foot pedal attached to one of the fuel dispensers, causing the pump to go into McQueen's fuel door and pump fuel into him. The gas bell rings as the screen shows the fuel dispenser with the gallons of fuel and total sale.]
Sheriff: Hey-Hey! What are you doin'?
Sally: It's OK, Sheriff. You can trust me, right?
Sheriff: I trust you, all right. It's him I'm worried about.
Sally: Mm... I trust him. [to McQueen] Come on, let's take a drive.
Lightning McQueen: A drive?
Sally: Yeah, a drive. Don't you big city race cars ever just take a drive?
Lightning McQueen: Uh, No. No, we don't.
:[The gas pump then stops and vibrates once. Sally then drives onto the road towards the courthouse, and McQueen moves himself to make the gas pump move back into its place. As McQueen drives onto the road, he turns towards the other side of the road and smiles as the screen shows the distance. Then Sheriff, thinking that McQueen is planning to escape, turns on his emergency lighting.]

21 - Drive with Sally
Sally: Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?
Flo: [Sally and McQueen fly and chuff the other way out of town toward the courthouse. McQueen then turns around and follows her.] Mm-hm! [to Sheriff] And you thought he was gonna run. [Sheriff turns off his emergency lighting.]
Ramone: Hey, can you believe it, man? He actually thought Doc was a famous race-car! [Laughing] That's so too much! [We then see Doc inside his garage looking outside the window, now feeling sad.]
Lightning McQueen: [The screen shows McQueen's catching up with Sally after they go past Radiator Cap Mountain, to Sally] Okay, you got me out here. Where are we going?
Sally: I don't know. [Then McQueen revs his engine and moves a bit ahead of Sally, then Sally revs hers and moves a bit ahead. McQueen does the same thing, then Sally races off.]
Lightning McQueen: Whoa! Yes!
:[McQueen then go faster as they race Sally through a forest. McQueen and eventually catch her up as they come towards a puddle across the road. The water splashed by Sally goes onto McQueen. McQueen sputters and shakes the water off. Sally giggles. Sally then comes across another puddle. McQueen and our heroes dodge the water splashed by her. McQueen laughs. Suddenly, some mud hits McQueen. McQueen groans and Sally giggles. Then McQueen come towards a pile of leaves on one side of the road. He hits it, and gets leaves covered over him. McQueen groans and Sally giggles, much to his anger. McQueen sputters and shakes most of the leaves off. Our heroes then drive, chuff and fly faster as the rest of the leaves come off McQueen. As they go past a lake, our heroes overtake Sally. Later, they go around a hairpin that goes uphill, and continue driving around the bends. McQueen and Sally smile as Sally drives past him. Then our heroes get surprised as they see a hill shaped like a car's front with the small road tunnel beneath it in place of a tire. Then they go through a longer tunnel in a bigger hill. As they come out, they see a waterfall behind a road bridge. McQueen then looks towards Sally, who was driving along the bridge. She then looks towards him, to which McQueen smiles, and we see a few bugs on the front of his teeth. Sally giggles. McQueen laughs, then notices the bugs on his teeth. Gasps and spits them off. Our heroes then cross the bridge and follow Sally along a zigzag of curves. The song then ended as they go around a regular left curve, and stop at an old motel.]

22 - Wheel Well
Lightning McQueen: Wow! What is this place?
Sally: Wheel Well. Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
Lightning McQueen: [McQueen then see a few gas pumps, and then look at some old cans and parts with flies flying and crawling.] This place? [The screen shows a closeup of the flies buzzing around and crawling. The car-ified bugs beep their horns. The camera then zooms out.]
Sally: [sighs] Yeah, imagine...Oh, imagine what it must've been like to stay here.
Lightning McQueen: [to Sally] You know, I don't get you. How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
Sally: Well, it's really pretty simple. I was... [drives into the motel, while our heroes follow her in.] ...an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and.
Lightning McQueen: Ah, you were, were you? Were you rich?
Sally: What?
Lightning McQueen: Just... clues to the puzzle.
Sally: Yeah, OK. Well, that was my life. And you know what? It never felt... happy.
Lightning McQueen: Yeah. I mean... really?
Sally: [Then, Sally sings her version of the song "What More Is Out There" to McQueen and explaining her contemplating her place at LA, living life in the fast lane and also lamenting that she feels trapped at California with all the other rich cars and cannot find somewhere she truly belongs. While all our heroes listen to Sally, McQueen sings to himself in his mind about his racing life in the past and now in the present but now realizes somehow he's lacking and missing something very important in his life, but he couldn't figure out what it is.] Yeah. So I left California. Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here. Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in. Well, they all did. And I never left. [Sally then drives out of the motel as the screen shows from behind one of the windows with a few flies crawling on it, along with a dead one being upside down. McQueen then follow Sally outside.]
Lightning McQueen: Yeah. Ya know, I understand. You need a little R & R. Recharge and old batteries. But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?
Sally: [Inhales deeply] I fell in love.
Lightning McQueen: Oh.
Sally: Yep.
Lightning McQueen: Corvette?
Sally: No. [drives to the cliff with small logs as barriers, as McQueen and the whole team follow her] I fell in love with this. 
:[The screen then changes to show the wonderful view of Ornament Valley and Radiator Springs.]

23 - "Our Town"
Lightning McQueen: Whoa. [seeing the mountain where the road led up to] Look at that. [sees some traffic driving on the Interstate 40 in the distance] Look, they're drivin' right by. They don't even know what they're missin'! ["Our Town" starts to play.]
Sally: Well, it didn't used to be that way.
Lightning McQueen: Oh, yeah?
Sally: Yeah. 40 years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist.
Lightning McQueen: Really? [The screen shows the Interstate again as it does an illusion of the Interstate fading and the hills joined up.]
Sally: Yeah. Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way.
Lightning McQueen: How do you mean? [The screen then goes to a flashback showing an aerial view of some traffic driving along Route 66 as Sally starts talking.]
Sally: Well, the road didn't cut through land like that Interstate. It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved. [The screen then shows at ground level as it moves from side to side beside the road with traffic going by.
Folk: Mornin'! Nice day, huh?
Sally: [narrating] Cars didn't drive on it to make a great time. They drove on it to have a great time.
:[The screen then moves around the center of Radiator Springs as the singing of "Our Town" starts. We see Flo serving a few drinks to her customers, as Mater, covered completely with blue paint, tows a red car named Percy Handbrakes to Flo's V8 Cafe. The screen then shows Sarge and Fillmore talking to each other as cars enter into Ramone's House of Body Art, and Ramone, in a dark red paint job with white at the bottom of his sides, comes out with Greta, who then goes to Luigi's Casa Della Tires. Mildred Bylane then comes out of the store with new tires, and drives away. Sheriff is seen sleeping beside the store. Then the screen goes back to Sally and McQueen.]
Lightning McQueen: Well, what happened?
Sally: The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.
:[The screen then shows a map, which shows the Interstate 40 being constructed and going past Route 66, including Radiator Springs. The screen then shows Red, Flo, Ramone, Luigi and Guido watch with excitement at the new highway under construction. Then the screen shows Radiator Springs again as Mater and Red the fire truck put a sign above the intersection, saying "Welcome, Interstate travelers". The screen shows on one side of the Interstate after its construction is finished, then some traffic appear driving along the highway, as the screen then changes to show on Radiator Springs' main road, with no traffic driving on it. We then see Mater, Sheriff, Lizzie, Fillmore, Sarge, Luigi, Guido, Flo, Ramone and Red looking sad. The screen then shows the map again as Radiator Springs' mark on it disappears as well as the thick red line and signs of Route 66 changing to a thin blue line. We then see several of the buildings behind Luigi's Casa Della Tires and Ramone's House of Body Art as they change to show that they have been closed down. We again see the same residents with a sad look at those buildings, then we see Ramone and Flo with Luigi and Guido as they head back to their stores. Luigi puts up a "We're still open" sign behind the window of his store. The camera then moves slowly backwards along the main road of Radiator Springs, showing "Open" signs at several of the stores along with the traffic light showing its red and green lights. The screen then changes to show the road at the present time and much further, with the traffic light blinking its amber light, and the partly-finished road, as we then see McQueen and Sally.]
Lightning McQueen: How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!
Sally: Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that. But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map.
Lightning McQueen: Yeah. [to Sally] Hey, listen, thanks for the drive. I had a great time. It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.
Sally: You're welcome. [drives back to the Cozy Cone Motel]
:[Suddenly, Mater rushes towards McQueen, looking worried.]

24 - Stampede
Mater: Hey, listen, listen! If anybody asks you, we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?! [drives away]
Lightning McQueen: [chuckling] Wha... What?
:[Suddenly, they hear a rumble. Then they look at the other end of the road to see what it is. The camera turns around to show that end of the road as a stampede of tractors appears driving towards the town. Tractors mooing. McQueen drive and jump off the road just as the tractors come towards them. The tractors drive through the town, as Flo, Sarge, Fillmore and Sheriff notice them from Flo's V8 Cafe. We then see Ramone using paint to spray the markings on the road. Red is watering his flowers. Ramone noticing the tractors]
Ramone: Oh, man, the paint's still wet! [drives away]
:[Red stops watering as he notices the tractors. Tractors mooing. Red moves in front of Stanley's statue and honks loudly at the tractors to make most of them tip. Tractors tipping mooing. One of the tractors who did not tip drives into Luigi's Casa Della Tires, as Luigi and Guido try to get it out.]
Luigi: No, no, no, no, get out of the store! [notices another tractor munching on a radial tire] Hey?! DON'T EAT THE RADIAL! Here, take-a the snow tires. [nudges a set of snow tires. We then see McQueen and the whole of arriving at the scene as Sheriff, Fillmore, Sarge and Mater drive around the town, with Sheriff chasing one of the tractors, another tractor between Fillmore and Sarge as they drive around, while Mater is not chasing a tractor.]
Sheriff: MATER!
Mater: I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
Sheriff: THEN WHERE DID ALL THESE GOL-DURN TRACTORS COME FROM?!
Fillmore: [McQueen laughs, exclaiming] WHOA, BOY! WHOA!

25 - Doc Races
Lightning McQueen: [noticing a tractor driving away from the town] Hey! Hey, guys, There's one goin' this way! [pause] I got it! [McQueen and the whole team then follow the tractor, who is driving towards Willy's Butte.] Come here, little tractor, come here. [The tractor then stops.] Yeah, that's a good tractor. [But the tractor then moves away.] No, no, no, no, come here. [But the tractor just drives away.] What are you doing? You're not supposed to go wandering off all--[notices Doc Hudson on the track]--alone. [Then the whole of all notice Doc on the track, as well. The screen then shows McQueen and the whole team as they get closer to a distance from the track, while the tractor drives back towards the town. McQueen noticing that Doc has his racing tires on] What are you doin' with those old racin' tires? [The screen does a closeup of Doc's side to show us one of his racing tires. It then moves to on the road to show him still standing there. Doc sighs heavily] [McQueen whispering] Come on, Doc, drive. [Doc looks towards the end of the track, then revs his engine. McQueen and smile as the camera does a closeup on Doc's front, the lining on his trunk and side, his rear, and his front and eyes, and he then sets off. Our heroes watch him happily. Doc drives along the hillside beside the first curve. As he drives along the next straight, our heroes get shocked as he comes towards the final curve where McQueen slid off before. Doc then does an opposite lock, where he turns his body to the left, and turns his wheels right while going around the curve perfectly. Doc then stops as he approaches the finish line, with the dust covering the camera for a few seconds until it shows him looking happy.]
Doc Hudson: [sighs heavily] Yeah.
Lightning McQueen: [Come toward Doc.] Wow! [noticing McQueen] You're amazing! [But Doc just angrily drives away. McQueen coughs from the dust] What are you doin'? Doc, wait! [McQueen then follow Doc as they arrive back in Radiator Springs. As Doc goes left on the crossroad back to his garage, McQueen and the whole team stop as the tractors drive along in a lineup with Mater behind. Tractors mooing. Mater hitting the back tractor with his hook]
Mater: Giddy-up right in there! Come on, Rusty. WHEE-HE!
Lightning McQueen: [McQueen and the whole of eventually catch up with Doc as he drives into his garage.] Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible!
Doc Hudson: Wonderful. Now, go away.
Lightning McQueen: [as he drive into the garage] Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
Doc Hudson: I'm askin' you to leave.
Lightning McQueen: Come on. I'm a race car, you're a much older race car, but under the hood you and I are the same.
Doc Hudson: We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out. [drives out of his garage]
Lightning McQueen: How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
Doc Hudson: [pauses] You think I quit? [Doc then presses a button on the garage floor to turn on a light beside our heroes, who then look to see a newspaper's front page on the wall saying "Crash! Hudson Hornet out for season".]
Lightning McQueen: Right. Your big wreck in 54.
Doc Hudson: They quit on me, when I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome, you know what they said? "You're history", moved right on to the next rookie standing in line, there was a lot left in me, I never got chance to show 'em, I keep that, to remind me never to go back, I just never expected that that world would find me here.
Lightning McQueen: Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
Doc Hudson: Oh, yeah?
Lightning McQueen: No, I'm not.
Doc Hudson: When is the last time you cared about somethin' except yourself, hot rod? You name me one time. And I will take it all back. [McQueen then feels ashamed.] Uh-huh? I didn't think so. [to McQueen, who then feels ashamed again] These are good folk around here, who care about one another. I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.
Lightning McQueen: Oh, like you? You've been here how long and your friends don't even know who you are? [Doc then looks hurt at McQueen's fact.] Who's caring about only himself?
Doc Hudson: Just finish that road and get outta here! [drives away]
:[The screen shows Radiator Cap Mountain and Cadillac Range the next morning, as the same reveille Sarge uses is heard playing. It is again interrupted by Fillmore playing "The Star-Strangled Banner".]
Sarge: Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?!
Fillmore: Respect the classics, man.

26 - He's Gone
:[The screen then shows Mater sleeping and snores in his house, shown to be drooling oil. He then snorts and putters as he wakes up, groans as he stretches himself. Mater smacks and sighs. Mater then drives to the main road, where he notices that it has been completed and there is no sign of McQueen and the whole of Mater and Doc are then shown driving to the end of the paving.]
Mater: He's done. He must've finished it while we was all sleepin'.
Doc Hudson: Good riddance. [Doc then drives away as the other residents arrive at the same scene. Ramone has a red paint job.]
Flo: He's gone?
Sarge: Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his. [Sally drives away.]
Sheriff: [sniffs]
Ramone: Oh, dude, are you crying?
Sheriff: NO! I'M HAPPY! I DON'T HAVE TO WATCH HIM EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY ANYMORE! I'M GLAD HE'S GONE!
Red: [blubbers, then sobs and drives away, again knocking down that same pile of tires at that corner of the impound. Just then, McQueen show up after just coming back through the portal.]
Lightning McQueen: What's wrong with Red?
Mater: [not realizing who he's talking to] Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town, and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup that you've always dreamed about your whole life and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about. [As he talks, the other residents then notice our heroes, looking glad. After finishing his quote, Mater stares at McQueen and the team as they are grinning. Mater gasps as he realizes who he was talking to] Wait a minute! [other laugh, smacks McQueen with his tire] I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
Lightning McQueen: [chuckles]
Sheriff: What are you doin' here, son? You're gonna miss your race. [turns on his emergency lighting] Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up the time.
Lightning McQueen: Thank you, Sheriff. But you know I can't go just yet.
Sheriff: Well, why not?
Lightning McQueen: I'm not sure these tires... [Luigi gasps excitedly] ...can get me all the way to California. [Guido: Pit stop?!] Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?
Luigi: [laughing] I can't-a believe it!

27 - A New Customer!
:[The screen then shows the residents and outside Luigi's Casa Della Tires, watching Luigi and Guido with McQueen.]
Luigi: Four new tires! Grazien, Mr. Lightning. [gives a hug] Grazien!
Flo: [Sally then arrives, feeling glad as she sees McQueen.] Would you look at that!
Luigi: Our first real customers in years! I am filled with tears of ecstasy, [while Luigi is talking, McQueen winks to and Sally, who is then shown smiling. Doc then appears, starting to feel angry hen he sees McQueen] for this is the most glorious day of my life!
Lightning McQueen: [as Luigi presses a button to make the car lift he is on go up] Alright, Luigi, give me the best set of black walls you've got.
Luigi: [releases the button, making the lift go back down] NO,No,No,No! You don't-a know what you want. Luigi know what you want. [drives to a couple of shelves, with one holding blackwall tires, and another being covered by a curtain] Black wall tires. They blend into the pavement. But-a this: [presses a button to pull the curtain, showing whitewall tires] "White-Wall Tires"! They say, "Look at me! Here I am! Love me."
Lightning McQueen: Alright, you're the expert.
Luigi: [chuckles and Doc snarls and drives away]
Lightning McQueen: Oh, and don't forget the spare.
Luigi: Perfetto. Guido!
Guido: Peet stop!
:[Guido is then shown holding his wheel gun, which is heard whirring as Chuck Berry's version of "Route 66" plays. Luigi is seen holding a flag up, attached to his antenna. He holds it up a bit more, which Guido make the wheel gun whir. Luigi then moves the flag down, and Guido then gets to work on unfastening the bolts on McQueen's tires, as Luigi dodges one of the tires going through the air. When Guido is finished putting the new tires, McQueen is shown looking at them in a mirror.]
Luigi: [chuckling] What did Luigi tell you, Huh?
Lightning McQueen: Wow, you were right! Better than a Ferrari, huh?
Luigi: [frowns] Eh, no.
Lightning McQueen: [McQueen then frowns, and then the screen shows him and the whole team with Fillmore at the Taste-Inn, drinking some organic fuel.] Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before?
Fillmore: It's a conspiracy, man!! The oil companies got a grip on the government!! They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man!
Lightning McQueen: OK, I'll take a case.
:[The screen then shows from McQueen's point of view as he looks around with night-vision goggles on, and Sarge is seen. The screen then McQueen as the goggles move up, then it shows Sarge hooked to some surplus with a note saying, "Guaranteed, no tailgaters." The screen then shows a close-up of a snow globe with Radiator Springs Curios and Knick in it. The screen zooms out to show McQueen and looking at it with Lizzie. It then shows some bumper stickers and other souvenirs. Lizzie is then shown putting some onto McQueen. McQueen yelps as Lizzie sticks on the third sticker. The screen then shows Ramone inside his shop, holding a paint hose. Ramone chuckles. McQueen is then seen, with covers for his tires, and breathes in deeply and closes his eyes as Ramone starts to paint him. Ramone sighs. As Ramone does a shade on a lightning bolt shape. The screen then shows the other townsfolk outside at sunset. Mater noticing Sally]
Mater: Here she comes!
Lightning McQueen: Okay, places, everybody. Hurry! Act natural.
Folks: [Red whistles as Sally arrives] Hi, Sally!
Sally: All right, what's goin' on?
Mater: Ladies and gentle cars, please welcome the new: Lightning McQueen!
:[Everyone moves out of the way as McQueen appears in his new paint job, revving his engine.]
Lightning McQueen: [posing] POW! What do you think? Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me.
Sally: [giggles] I'll say. [purrs as McQueen continues revving his engine] Ka-chow. You're gonna fit right in in California. Oh, my goodness, it looks like you've helped everybody in town.
Lightning McQueen: Everybody except one.
:[Sally is shown with a happy look.]

28 - Cruisin'
Lightning McQueen: Hey, is it getting dark out?
Lizzie: What!? What'd he say?
Lightning McQueen: Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out?!
Lizzie: Now, what was I supposed to do after that?
:[Red then presses a button on the radio, making Lizzie jump. The Chords' "Sh-Boom" is heard as the buildings' lights turn on. Ramone's House of Body Art is shown with its lights turning on. Luigi, Guido and Flo are shown at their buildings, looking glad as the lights turn on.]
Sally: [Gasping] They fixed their neon.
:[The lights on Radiator Springs Curios turn on, then the ones at Fillmore's Taste-In, as Fillmore drives out, looking glad. Then the screen shows the lights on Sarge's Surplus Hut. It then shows Ramone and Flo at the crossroad.]
Flo: Low and slow?
Ramone: Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckles as they take a cruise along the main road to the Courthouse. Flo laughs and shrieks. McQueen to Sally]
Lightning McQueen: Just like in its heyday, right?
Sally: [exhales] It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you.
:[The screen then shows different shots as the other townsfolk and the engines are shown cruising and the rest of are shown dancing on the sidewalks. Ramone chuckles as he lifts his bodywork up and presses his rear end on the tarmac, creating sparks. Noticing what Ramone did, Mater then presses his whole bodywork on the tarmac, creating a lot of sparks.]
Lightning McQueen: Shall we cruise?
Lizzie: [appearing out of nowhere] Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to! [pulls McQueen away]
Lightning McQueen: No no no!
Sally: Lizzie!
Lizzie: [to McQueen as they drive along] I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.
Mater: [to Mater] Hey, "Miss Sally." May I have this cruise?
Sally: Of course, Mater.
Sheriff: [stopping them] A-A-Ah!
:[The screen then shows that the traffic lights at the crossroad are now showing all the lights, as they change to red for Sally, Mater and a line of tractors then drive across, mooing.]
Lizzie: ...and again and I said, "no," and he asked me again, and I said, "no..." [Sally giggles as she notices McQueen stepping sideways while with Lizzie] ...but, oh, he was a persistent little burger for a two-cylinder... [continues driving, while McQueen stops and turns around] ...finally I said, "alright, one little drive..." [McQueen looks to see the other townsfolk still cruising. Suddenly, Mater grabs him with his tow hook.]
Lightning McQueen: OH!
Mater: [laughs, "Dah ha ha ha ha ha!" tows him to Sally, and lets go]
Lightning McQueen: Hey!
Sally: Thanks, Mater.
Mater: Good evenin', you two! [McQueen and Sally then look at each other. Lizzie standing next to Stanley's statue]
Lizzie: Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this. [McQueen and Sally then touch each other's front. Flo noticing something]
Flo: Is that what I think it is?
Sally: Oh, I don't know, Flo. I haven't had a chance to find out. [both her and McQueen close their eyes] But I am going to find out. Hello.
Flo: Not that! That!
Sally: [Everyone then looks into the distance to see lots of headlights approaching. Sally gasping] Customers?
Flo: Customers, everybody! And a lot of 'em! You know what to do, just like we rehearsed!
Mater: [Suddenly, a blue light shines on McQueen. A townsfolk gasp] It's the Ghost-Light!

29 - McQueen is Found
Kathy Copter: [shown to be shining the light] We have found McQueen! We have found McQueen!
Cameramen: [It is then shown that the people who have arrived are actually the press, coming towards McQueen and surrounding him, flashing their cameras.] McQueen, over here, kid!
Lightning McQueen: Oh, wait......Excuse me.
Cameramen: Is it true you've been in rehab?! Did you have a nervous breakdown, McQueen?!
Lightning McQueen: I'm sorry, what?
Cameramen: McQueen's wearin' whitewalls! Are the tires you wearin' are turning baldin'?!
Sally: Stickers, McQueen!
Cameramen: [to Mater] Was Lightning McQueen your prisoner?!
Mater: Shoot, no, we're best buds! I ain't braggin' or nothin', but I was in charge of huntin' him down if he tried to escape.
Lightning McQueen: Sally, Sally!
Kori Turbowitz: McQueen, will you still race for the Piston Cup?!
Sally: Stickers?!
Lightning McQueen: Sally!
Cameramen: Come on, give us some bolt! [Suddenly, a horn honks, and the press clear the way for Mack.]
Mack: YOU'RE HERE! Thank the manufacturer, you're alive!
Lightning McQueen: Mack?!
Mack: [Mack turning around] You're here! I can't believe it! [Sally then watches as she notices the picture on the side of Mack's trailer. Mack chuckles to McQueen] You are a sight for sore headlights! I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you...
Lightning McQueen: Mack, I can't believe you're here!
Harv: Is that the world's fastest racing machine?
Lightning McQueen: Is that "Harv"?
Mack: Yeah, he's in the back. [splits from his trailer, and McQueen turns around to the trailer door]
Houser Boon: Show us the bolt, McQueen!

Lightning McQueen: How ya doin', buddy?
Harv: My star client disappears off the face of the earth! How do you think I'm doin'?!
Lightning McQueen: Harv, I can explain.
Harv: I'm doing great! You're everywhere, baby, radio, TV, the papers! You can't buy this kinda publicity! What do you need me for?! That's just a figure of speech by the way you signed a contract. Where are you?! I can't even find you on my GPS.
Lightning McQueen: I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs. Ya know Route 66? It's still here!
Harv: Yeah, that's great, kid. Playtime is over, pal. While the world's been tryin' to find you, Dinoco has had no one to woo. Who are they gonna woo?
Lightning McQueen: [whispering] Chick.
Harv: Bingo, in fact, check out what's on the plasma right now.
:[The TV in McQueen's trailer then shows some photographers with Chick, who now has a thundercloud, lightning bolt and "C" between his tire and front, and is seen with Mia and Tia, who have green paint and "C" merchandise.]
Cameramen: [on TV] Show us the thunder!
Chick: [on TV] You want thunder? You want thunder?! [reflects sunlight on the "C" insignia] Ka-chicka, ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! [laughing]
Lightning McQueen: Hey, that's my bit!
Harv: You've gotta get to Cali, pronto! Just get outta Radiation Stinks now, or Dinoco is history, ya hear me?
Lightning McQueen: [noticing Sally beside the trailer] Just give me a second here, Harv. [drives to Sally]
Harv: No, no, wait, where are you goin'?! Get in the trailer, baby! Kid, you wa... You want a bigger trailer?!
Lightning McQueen: Sally, I want you to, look, I wish--[sighs]

Harv: Come on, kid, get in the trailer. That's it. That's right, kid, let's go! You're a big shining star. You're a superstar. You don't belong there, anyway.
Lightning McQueen: [As Harv is talking, McQueen takes one last look at the town and the whole of before the trailer door starts to close.] Whoa Wait Whoa Whoa Wait Wait! [The door closes, and Mack starts his engine as he gets going as other photographers are with Luigi, Guido and Red]

Doc Hudson: It's best for everyone, Sally.
Sally: Best for everyone, or best for you? [drives away, Doc is shown frowning, and Sally comes onto the main road to watch Mack and the press drive away with McQueen. The other townsfolk are seen behind her, watching as well and wanting to cry. Doc then joins them.]

The screen then shows an aerial view of the circuit, before coming back to the ground to show McQueen driving to Mack, who is wearing a headset.] Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today.
Mack: Na. Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do. After all, "Gas Can" is my middle name.

Darrell Cartrip: Wearin' whitewall tires, of all things. [McQueen grunts and as Chick's "C" sticker shines sunlight over his eyes]
Chick: Ka-chicka, Ka-chicka, Ka-chicka! [laughs] Hey, where you been? I've been kinda lonely. Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks. Aw, and the twins. Of course. You know the twins the one that used to be your fans, but now they're my fans. Anyway, listen to what the twins think...

Darrell Cartrip: [as McQueen gets beside Chick] Hey, McQueen's got a run on him! He's lookin' to the inside! [But then, Chick goes right in front of McQueen, causing him to brake.] Oh, Chick slammed the door on him!
Bob Cutlass: Chick's not makin' it easy on him today.
Darrell Cartrip: Oh, man, he lost so much momentum, and now he's gonna have to chase him back down!
:[The screen changes to McQueen's point of view as he sees the King and Chick ahead. The screen then changes as McQueen daydreams again, showing him following Sally and the whole of driving, chuffing and flying through the woods, as soft music is heard along with birds singing.

Bob Cutlass: OH!!! McQueen spins out in the infield!
:[Mia and Tia gasp along with the crowd. McQueen then comes to a stop on the infield.]
Chick: [chuckles] Just me and the old man, fellas. McQueen just doesn't have it today.

Chief Chick and Roger Wheeler: [through the radio] Hey, kid, are you alright?
Lightning McQueen: I don't know, Mack. I don't think I-
Chief Chick and Roger Wheeler: [through the radio] I didn't come all this way to see you quit.

Doc Hudson: I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad.
Lightning McQueen: I thought you said you'd never come back.
Doc Hudson: Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
Mater: Goodbye! Okay, I'm good.
Lightning McQueen: [chuckles]
Doc Hudson: [McQueen then comes to the pits, as Mater holds the sign, which has Radiator Springs' logo on it. Fillmore and Sarge refuel McQueen, to McQueen] Alright, if you can drive as good as you fix a road, then you can win this race with you eyes shut. Now, get back out there! [McQueen then drives back out through the pit lane.] Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi! You're goin' up against professional pit crews boys, you're gonna have to be fast.
Luigi: They will not know what bit them!
Doc Hudson: [to McQueen] Kid, [through the radio] you can beat these guys. Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back!
:[McQueen then goes faster, going around the bends and catching up. Then the Dinoco pit crew notice Doc in his look, murmuring as they see him.]
Chick's Crew: Is that? Oh, wow. That's him!
TV Crew: Is that--? That's the Hudson Hornet! Bob, Darrell, the Hudson Hornet's back!
Bob Cutlass: Darrell, it appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew. And look who he has for a crew chief! [All of the cameramen turn their cameras to show Doc, and the crowd then notices him.]

Bob Cutlass: McQueen passes them on the inside!
Darrell Cartrip: But he's still nearly a lap down!

Doc Hudson: You're goin' great, kid. Just keep your head on.
Guido: Vai, vai, vai! [pushes a cart of tires away]
Chick's crew: Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh? Those round things are called tires, and they go UNDER THE CAR!
All Chick's Crew: [laughing]
Guido: [angered] Con chi credi di parlare?! Ma, con chi stai parlando?!
Luigi: No, no, no! You'll have your chance, you'll have your chance.
:[McQueen is then seen racing, progressing through the race and managing to get to Chick and the King, as McQueen gets beside him]
Chick: Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh? Well, what do ya think of this?! [hits McQueen, causing him to spin] Yeah, that's it kid. [But McQueen manages to keep up with going backwards and past Chick.] What?
Mater: Whoa! GitRDone! [McQueen winks, and turns back around. Mater laughs] I taught him that. [poses to Chick's pit crew] KA CHOW!
Chick's Crew: [getting their eyes hit by the sunlight reflecting off Mater's wing mirror] AH!!!
Bob Cutlass: What a move by McQueen, he's caught up to the leaders!
Darrell Cartrip: Oh, yeah. This is what it's all about. A 3-way battle for the lead, with 10 to go!
Tex: [chortles] Look at that boy go out there!
Chick: [Chick then tries to get past McQueen, but gets blocked on several attempts. Chick gasps and grunts, before coming up beside McQueen] ...No You don't! [presses against McQueen, causing a puncture in one of his rear tires]
Lightning McQueen: Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!
Doc Hudson: Can you get back to the pits?
Lightning McQueen: Yeah, yeah. I think so.
Doc Hudson: [noticing Dexter waving a yellow flag] Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid. [Charlie Checker then comes out in front of the King and Chick.]
Mack: We gotta get him back out there fast or we're gonna be a lap down, and we'll never win this race!
Doc Hudson: Guido, it's time.
Chick Crew: Hey, tiny, you gonna clean his windshield?! [everyone laughing]
:[As McQueen comes into the pits, Guido throws the new tires up in the air, quickly takes off the old tires and catches the new tires, and puts them on, lasting four seconds, before McQueen gets going again. Chick's crew then feel shocked, and all of the pities' grilles, except the one of Wide Chick Pity, fall off.]
Darrell Cartrip: I don't believe it!
Bob Cutlass: That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
Darrell Cartrip: It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car out!

Bob Cutlass: This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen is right behind the leaders. What a comeback!
Darrell Cartrip: A hundred and ninety-nine laps, and, baby, it all comes down to this!
Doc Hudson: This is it, kiddo. [through the radio to McQueen] You've got 4 turns left, 1 at a time. Drive it in deep and hope it sticks...GO!
:[McQueen closes in, revving his engine, and is about to pass Chick, who tries get in front again, but McQueen swerves and goes to the other side.]
Chick: We'll see about that! [tries to get in front of McQueen, who then brakes, causing Chick to press against the wall, and making McQueen able to go past]
Bob Cutlass: McQueen's going inside! [But then, Chick rams McQueen off the track, and then hits the King, causing them both to serpentine.] Chick and The King are loose!
Darrell Cartrip: I think McQueen is outta the race! [McQueen suddenly gets a thought, and turns his front tires right, impressing Doc and surprising the team as it helps McQueen to get back on the track and past the King and Chick.] McQueen saved it!
Bob Cutlass: He's back on the track!
Doc Hudson: Float like a Cadillac...
Lightning McQueen: Sting like a Beemer!

Lynda Weathers: Oh, no.
:[Doc feeling and looking shocked. Then McQueen notices on the circuit's television screen what has happened, then the screen changes to show the newspaper about Doc's crash. Realizing what had happened to Doc, McQueen grinds to a halt before reaching the finish line, leaving the crowd shocked and puzzled. Chick crossing the finish line]
Chick: Yeah! Whoo-hoo! [goes onto the infield and spins around] I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Flo: What's he up to, Doc?
:[Doc then gets a smile before McQueen drives backwards towards the King. The injured King grunts and moans.]
The King: What are you doin', kid?
Lightning McQueen: I think The King should finish his last race. [begins to push the King along the track]
The King: You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that?
Lightning McQueen: Ah, this grumpy old racecar I know once told me somethin'. It's just an empty cup.
:[Doc smiles, as well as the crowd.]
Bob Cutlass: Darrell, is pushin' on the last lap legal?
Darrell Cartrip: Hey, man. He's not really pushing him. He's just givin' him a little bump draft.
Chick: [still cheering] Woo hoo! [stops spinning upon noticing that the crowd is not paying attention to him] Hey! What?! What's going on?!
R.M.: That's what I call racing right there.

Come on, snap some pictures. I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco! Ka-chicka! Say it with me. Ka-chicka, ka-chicka, ka-chicka!
:[The crowd starts to boo at Chick]
Cameramen: Boo!
Mia & Tia: Boo!
Chick: What's wrong with everybody? [gets hit by a tire] Ow! Where's the happiness?! [the press throw multiple Chick Hicks merchandise at him] Hey! This is the start of the Chick era! [leaves with his trophy. Meanwhile, McQueen pushes the King back to the Dinoco stage. Lynda then kisses McQueen on the cheek.]

Lightning McQueen: [feels surprised, looks at the Dinoco stage with all their members happy to welcome their new racer. Rotor Turbosky winks at McQueen] But I didn't win.
Tex: Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racin' than just winnin'.
:[Lightning looks back at the Rust-eze tent with all his rusty supporters and friends from Radiator Springs cracking jokes]
Dusty: He was so rusty, when he drove down the street buzzards used to circle the car!
Lightning McQueen: Thank, you, Mr. Tex, but...but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break. I'm gonna stick with them.
Tex: Well, I sure can respect that. Still, ya know, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.
Lightning McQueen: I sure appreciate that, thank you... Actually, there's 1 thing...

31 - Back on the Map
Mater: [riding in Rotor Turbosky, Dinoco is helicopter, over Radiator Springs] WHOO-HOO! [laughs] Hey, look at me! I'm flyin', by golly! Whoo-hoo! [as most of the Radiator Springs residents watch from the ground] I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park! [Then the screen shows Luigi and Guido looking at their tire shelves in their store.]
Luigi: [to Guido] I think it's about-a time we redecorate.
Michael Schumacher: [revving his engine] [arriving with Antonio Veloce Eccellente and Costanzo Della Corsa] Ciao! Hi, Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires. How 'bout settin' me and my friends up with three or four sets each?
Luigi: [Gasps] Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store. A REAL FERRARI! Punch me, Guido, punch me in the face! This is the most glorious day of my life! [Faints]
Michael Schumacher: Whoa, [speaks Italian to Guido] spero che il tuo amico si riprenda. Mi dicono che siete fantastici.

Sally: Just passin' through?
Lightning McQueen: Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile, I hear this place is back on the map.
Sally: It is?
Lightning McQueen: Yeah, there's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar is setting up his big racin' headquarters here.
Sally: Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.
Lightning McQueen: Ya know, I really missed you, Sally.
Sally: Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Lightning McQueen: [chuckles as they move slowly toward each other, Mater appearing onboard Rotor]
Mater: McQueen and Sally parked beneath the tree, K-i-s-s... auuu... i-n-t!
Lightning McQueen: Great timing, Mater!
Mater: [as Rotor flies away] Hepnon, hiphep, hilililly! Wheeeeeee!!
Lightning McQueen: [to Sally] He's my best friend. What're you gonna do?
Sally: So, Stickers. Last one to Flo's buys?
Lightning McQueen: I don't know. Why don't we just take a drive?
Sally: Hmm, nah. [quickly drives away]
Lightning McQueen: Yeah, Ka-chow! [follows Sally and as they race each other, while John Mayer's version of "Route 66" plays, with Mater yelling while riding in Rotor.]
